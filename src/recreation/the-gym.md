# The gym

I'm very fortunate to have the space for a gym at home.

## Construction

The foundation of the gym is a 10m x 10m reinforced concreate slab, 125mm
thick. The structure is a steel frame with Colourbond sheeting for walls and
ceiling. Agpipe drainage is installed on the northern, western and eastern
sides of the slab. A spoon drain is present on the southern side.

The ceiling is fully insulated with ...tbd... The walls insulation is a work in
progress, using 10mm FoilBoard.

4 x 20W LED batten lights are installed on the ceiling joists.

## Airflow

- 1 x 3m x 2.5m facing north;
- 1 x 3m x 2.5m facing east.

A solar powered extraction fan is located in the centre of the roof, which
activates under sunlight at temperatures greater than 25 degrees.
