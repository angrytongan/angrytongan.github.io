# Ergometer Volume Testing

---

## tl;dr

Decibel levels of a Concept2 rower, Concept2 SkiErg, Concept2 BikeErg and Rogue
Echo Bike were measured at various intensities over short periods of time using
a sound level meter in a gym setting. Individual results were collated. The
results show that ergometers are roughly on the order of <...>

## About this experiment

A common question on many internet forums that discuss ergometers for use at
home is "How loud are they?" (such as

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rowing/comments/1iqbkx6/concept2_noise_level/),

Answers are largely anecdotal, but there have been attempts to measure the
decibel level of an ergometer (such as Training Tall [testing a Concept2 RowErg
and a WaterRower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrRn65owFrA) and RowAlong
[testing a Concept2 RowErg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62VtT6pakyI&t=79)).

This experiment attempts to measure the volume output of a [Concept2
RowErg](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/rowerg), [Concept2
SkiErg](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/skierg), [Concept2
BikeErg](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/bikeerg) and [Rogue Echo
Bike](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-echo-bike) in a controlled setting.

## Methodology

Here we describe how the experiments and testing method were setup.

### The environment

Testing was undertaken inside a 10m x 10m steel shed (4.5m walls to eave; 5.8m
to ceiling apex) resting on a 150mm concrete slab. The external cladding of
walls and ceiling is ColorBond steel. The internal ceiling is wrapped with
sarking. The internal eastern and western walls are covered with foilboard
insulation to a height of 3m. The eastern wall has an additional internal layer
of timber frame and plywood to a height of 3m.

Two roll-up garage doors are located on the northern wall. One roll-up garage
door is located on the western wall.A small window is located on the western
wall. All doors and window were open to their full heights during the
experiments.

The floor is almost completely covered with 1m x 1m x 15mm rubber gym mats.

Various fitness equipment of differing shapes are located along the eastern and
western walls. Two large foam mats are located on the floor along the western
wall.

### Ergometer positioning

Each ergometer was placed in the middle of the shed for each run of experiments.
The ergomenters were positioned such that an athlete operating the ergometer
would be facing the northern wall. The axle of the flywheel was placed over the
centre of the shed.

### Measuring positions

Volume was measured with the digital sound level meter attached to a tripod.
Recordings were done at 4 different angles and 4 different distances from the
ergometer, yielding 16 different measurement points:

-   4 angles as measured from the centre of the shed:
    -   directly in front of the ergometer;
    -   90° clockwise from the front of the ergometer;
    -   90° counter-clockwise from the front of the ergometer; and
    -   directly behind the ergometer.

-   4 distances as measured from the bounding box of the ergometer and athlete:
    -   10cm;
    -   1m;
    -   2m; and
    -   3m.

<div class="note">
"Bounding box" refers to a tight-fitting, imaginary box that encloses both the
ergometer and athlete. Since the ergometer and athlete occupy space, it is not
feasible to measure relative to the flywheel, as the digital sound level meter
may need to exist inside the ergometer or athlete. Measuring from the bounding
box is more practical and should not dramatically affect the results.
</div>

In all measuring positions, the digital sound level meter microphone was oriented
vertically at a height of <...> from the floor mats.

### Control

The control measures of 0:20 were taken in the absence of any ergometer, at 4
angles previously noted, and distances as previously noted but measured from the
centre of the shed. No intentional sounds were made during the control
measurement.

### Other baselines

To give a real-world comparison of volume, measurements were also done against
some common household apparatus:

-   domestic vacuum cleaner;
-   Apple HomePod Mini playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture, volume setting x;
-   Apple HomePod Mini playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture, volume setting y;
    and
-   Apple HomePod Mini playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture, volume setting z.

In all these baselines, the apparatus was placed at the centre of the shed.

### Procedure

1.  The ergometer being tested was placed with the axle of the flywheel
    positioned over the centre of the shed. The ergometer was positioned such
    that when an athlete is using it, the athlete is facing north.
2.  The digital sound level meter was placed at a distance of 10cm from the
    front of the ergometer / athlete bounding box.
3.  The digital sound level meter started recording.
4.  The athlete ran a gamut of tests. For apparatus with a damper:
    1.  Damper closed at a pace of 2:00 for 0:20.
    2.  Damper open half-way at a pace of 2:00 for 0:20.
    3.  Damper open full at a pace of 2:00 for 0:20.
    For apparatus without a damper:
    1.  Pace of 2:00 for 0:20.
5.  Step 4 was repeated with the digital sound level meter positioned 1m, 2m and
    3m from bounding box.
6.  Steps 2 through 5 were repeated at 90° clockwise, 90° counter-clockwise, and
    directly behind the ergometer.
