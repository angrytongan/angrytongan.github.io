        <h1>Year of the Engine Program Review - Year 1</h1>

        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>I completed the first year of <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains
            Lab</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a>
            capacity program by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegainslab1/">Matt Wiebke</a>.
            My results show <a href="#objective-results-in-program-tests-10-minute-air-bike">
            11% performance improvement in the 10:00.0 air bike
            time trial</a>, and maintained my pace within 5% of competition pace on
            500m and 2k rowing ergometer time trials. Metabolic conditioning
            performance remained largely unchanged without any specific
            training. I recommend the program if you wish to improve your
            cardiovascular capacity.

        <h2 id="about-this-review">About this review</h2>
        <p>
        Whilst going through the Year of the Engine program, I would
        occasionally reflect on my results to determine how I was progressing. I
        realised I had accumulated a significant amount of data which is
        collated into this review. My hope is to give people who are interested
        in the program concrete information in the way of results, as well as
        subjective information in the way of review and opinion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        A box like this describes a decision, experience or an observation that I
        made while on the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
        I have worked with The Gains Lab previously, having completed five months of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegainslab.com/dominate">Total
            Domination</a> program about 9 months prior to starting Year of the
        Engine. I have also done some behind-the-scenes work on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains Lab
            website</a>, in exchange for a reduced rate on this program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">Workout obfuscation</h3>
        <p>
        For purposes of discussion, only a few workouts that comprise the
        program are described in detail in this review. All other workout
        descriptions are obfuscated to protect the content of the program. This
        obfuscation is described in more detail <a href="#program-workouts">below</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-data">Data</h3>
        <p>
        The results and graphs presented in this review come directly from data
        collected throughout the program. The raw data is <a
            href="charts/data.js">available here</a>.
        </p>

        <!-- program -->
        <h2 id="program">Program Overview</h2>
        <p>
        A broad overview of the program is provided below. More detail is available on <a
            target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab
            Engine</a> page. Matt also
        gives a good summary <a

        </p>

        <h3 id="program-phases">Phases</h3>
        <div id="graph-phases"></div>
        <p>
        The program has four phases. Each phase builds on the work from the
        previous phase, necessitating completing each one before starting the
        next.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>

        </table>

        <h3 id="program-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <div id="graph-tracks"></div>
        <p>
        The Polarisation and Differentiation phases (months 4 to 9) are split in two
        tracks that you can choose from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure capacity</strong> ergometer only track. Workouts are
                apparatus only.</li>
            <li><strong>MetCon</strong> Metabolic conditioning-style track. Workouts
                utilise multi-movement patterns with varying equipment (eg. barbells,
                dumbbells, wallballs, jump rope, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        It is possible to mix and match between tracks, and change tracks
        between phases.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        Workouts were received via email each month as a single .pdf file. Each
        file contains four weeks of workouts, each week having five workouts to
        complete.
        </p>
        <p>
        An exception to this format is the first month of the program, in
        which the fifth workout in each week is optional.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workout-types">Workout types</h3>
        <div id="graph-workout-types"></div>
        <p>
        Each workout type is described below. As <a
             href="#about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">mentioned above</a>, only a
        select number of workouts are described in full in this document; all
        other workout descriptions are obfuscated according to the rules below.

        <h3 id="program-equipment">Equipment</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine uses ergometers. The program as supplied gives options for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rowing on the Concept2 indoor rowing machine or similar;</li>
            <li>Skiing on the Concept2 indoor SkiErg or similar;</li>
            <li>Biking on the Assault Bike, Echo Bike, BikeErg, AirDyne or
                similar; and</li>
            <li>Running.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Each workout can use a different piece of equipment, allowing changing
        apparatus to suit your particular circumstances. Scalings are supplied
        for different apparatus, and the program strongly suggests which machines
        are <i>not</i> suitable for certain workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program provides no instruction on how to use any particular apparatus.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-additional-training">Additional Training</h3>
        <p>
        The program can be run as standalone or in addition to other training.
        Integration with other training is left to the athlete to manage.

        <h3 id="methodology-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        As <a href="#program-workouts">previously noted</a>, there are two tracks you
        can choose during the Polarisation and Differentiation phases: pure capacity or
        metabolic conditioning.
        </p>
        <p class="self">
        I chose <strong>pure capacity</strong>. All references to workouts in
        this review will only be for this track, and not for the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
        The program places no restriction on what days workouts are to occur,
        only that each weeks' workouts are to be completed before moving to the
        next week.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program deliberately allows you to move workouts around during the week in
        order to fit in with other training and life events.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I tried to do shorter workouts (intervals, time trials) at the start
            of the week, and longer workouts (endurance, polarisation, FLUX) at
            the end of the week and the weekend to fit in with life. Sorta worked.
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose not to explicitly schedule rest days, taking a day off when
            tired or if non-training appointments conflicted with normal
            training times.
            </p>
            <p>
            My workouts were predominantly done between 05:00 and 09:00.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="methodology-additional-training">Additional training</h3>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            During the Polarisation and Differentiation phases, I was able to
            fit in strength training of less than 45 minutes, between two and
            three times per week. Exercises rotated between various
            combinations of back squat, press, deadlift, front squat, bench
            press and pull-ups.  Maintenance weight only; loads did not
            increase. These workouts were done immediately before the scheduled
            Year of the Engine workout for that day.
            </p>

            <p>
            I completed perhaps a half-dozen MetCon workouts over the course of
            the program, as part of social events and not as part of training. I
            did not do a Year of the Engine workout on these days due to lack of
            time.
            </p>

            <p>
            All other exercise was incidental. This included bike riding,
            a swimming session no more than once every month, playing with
            my kids.

        <h3 id="methodology-recording-results">Recording results</h3>
        <p>
        The .pdf supplied each month has space to write results and specifies
        what to record for each workout. Matt suggests printing out each sheet
        and recording results in this fashion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        On the rower and SkiErg I used Concept2's <a
            target="_blank" href="https://concept2.com/ergdata">ErgData</a>
        application to record each session. The AirDyne lacks automated
        recording, so I took a photo of the monitor at the end of each workout
        and tabled the results in a spreadsheet.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-execution">Execution</h3>
        <p>
        I started the program on Monday 16th September 2019, and finished on
        16th September, 2020. Workouts, and their phases, were completed as
        below.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-execution-summary"></div>
        <p>
        Some workouts were shifted between weeks due to life. On occasion I
        completed more than 5 workouts per week, others were less than 5 per
        week.

            Air Bike time trial</h4>
        <p>
        The 10:00.0 air bike test is scheduled three times in phase 1 (weeks 4, 8,
        12) and three times in phase 3 (weeks 25, 29, 33). These tests are not
        placed ouside of the workout schedule; they are included as part of
        training. No special preparation was taken for these tests. Warm-up was
        roughly 3-4 minutes at below Endurance pace, 3-4 minutes at Endurance
        pace, 1-2 minutes above Endurance pace.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-tt-airdyne"></div>
        <p>
        There was 11.2% increase in calories recorded by the AirDyne monitor
        between the first and last test.

        <p class="self">
        All three tests felt RPE 10. The last two tests I did not feel the need
        to collapse on the floor, and sat upright on the bike slowly spinning
        the pedals while recovering.

        <p>
        The 20:00.0 rower test is scheduled three times in phase 3 (weeks 27,
        31, 35). These tests are not placed outside of the workout schedule;
        they are included as part of training. No special preparation was taken
        for these tests. Warm up was 10:00.0 build drill.

        <p>
        There was 2.8% increase in calories recorded by the rower monitor
        between the first and last test. Pace increased by 1.3s/500m between
        tests 1 and 2, but only 0.1s/500m between tests 2 and 3.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        Test 3 felt very poor. I was unwell at the end of the previous week and
        was most likely still recovering. While faster than test 1, it was
        equal to test 2. I bonked with less than 4 minutes to go, whereas pace
        was held throughout tests 1 and 2. This is easily visible by comparing
        the pace graph for the three tests, shown overlaid below.

        <p>
        Some workouts are repeated throughout the program. While these are not
        marked as tests, they do allow tracking of progress throughout the
        program by comparing like sessions. A small number of repeated workouts
        are provided below for discussion.

        <h4 id="objective-results-repeated-workouts-24x0:30/30r">24x0:30/0:30r</h4>
        <p>
        24x0:30/0:30r (24 intervals of 30 seconds work, 30 seconds rest) is
        scheduled once each in phases 1, 3 and 4 (weeks 11, 27, 45).  I
        completed the 1st and 3rd workout on the rower, and the second on the
        SkiErg. Here we will consider just the rower results.

        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30"></div>

        <p>
        A cursory glance indicates the second workout was poorer than the first.
        A closer look raises some questions. In the second attempt, the calorie
        count is lower, but both the distance is further and the pace is
        faster, albeit by the smallest of deltas.  Does the second attempt show
        improvment over the first?

        <p>
        Haemoglobin was measured from a drop of blood taken by finger pinprick
        and examined in a handheld battery operated analyser as part of the
        plasma donation acceptance criteria in Australia. This was performed
        approximately every two weeks, except for two occasions when four weeks
        elapsed between recordings.

        Weight was measured by consumer-grade weigh scales. This was performed

        on the same day as plasma donation to coincide with other recorded data.

        XXX need to clarify this - good argument to calculate SD and graph it

        There was no significant change in weight, although there was a spike
        coming into Christmas which we will never speak of again. Ahem.

        <p>
        My approach to workouts has changed. The higher-than-comfortable
        sustained "steady state" work from the program has changed my perception
        of the usefulness of fly-and-die. I now temper opening rounds in a
        workout aiming for 100% consistency instead of going too hard early
        and trying to recover on the run.

        <p>
        My &ldquo;skill&rdquo; level on the air bike has significantly improved.
        The cycling motion is now more refined with significantly less lateral
        movement. In particular, bobbing of the head left and right has
        vanished, with torso remaining much more still and upright. These
        improvements feel like I'm putting more energy into the bike rather
        than away from it.

        <p>
        Part of a post I made on <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/fqf4h9/blood_donations_exercise_and_recovery_periods/">/r/crossfit</a>
            in early 2020:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
            Up until end of last year, I would donate plasma on a Saturday
            morning after a workout, then rest until late Sunday afternoon to do
            my next workout - averaging between 30 and 33 hours of rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            Schedule change at start of the year meant donating on Sunday
            morning, resting until Monday morning workout - averaging between 23
            to 25 hours of rest. So a decrease of around 7 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since the schedule change, I've noticed significant drop offs in
            performance in that first workout after donating. The sensation
            during the workout isn't of a fatigue brick, huge drop in energy or
            I-think-I'm-dying; it's more of a "I can't sustain this pace even
            though I should be able to," and so I slow to make it through
            without stopping. Subsequent workouts, spaced at 24-hour periods,
            are fine.
            </p>
            <p>
            All other things being equal, the altered rest period
            seems to affect me significantly, with age no doubt playing a part
            too. Some random Googling turned up

        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-right">What I believe I got right</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Followed the program</strong>. Adherence
                to the program was initially difficult, but once a proper
                schedule was established, and an understanding of the amount of
                effort required to complete the first couple of months was
                achieved, it became much easier to follow the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Moved workouts around inside the training
                week</strong>. In order to fit the workouts into my schedule, it
                was necessary to move them within the week rather than strictly
                follow the program. This is provided for in the program. Had I
                tried to do the workouts in order as written, it would have
                been nearly impossible to fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Rested only when necessary, not more</strong>. I explicitly
                chose not schedule rest days into my week, instead opting to
                rest when tired or when non-training events prevented training.
                This worked well; some weeks I would do 6 days in a row,
                starting the next weeks' training early. Other weeks life would
                get in the way and I might miss a few days in a row. I feel if I
                had tried to stick hard to a schedule, I would have missed a lot
                more days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-wrong">What I know got wrong</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Not stretching</strong>. During phase 2, I started
                getting a lot of lower back, glute and hip flexor pain. This
                was probably caused by an increase of time on the AirDyne
                during this phase. I was not used to sitting on a stationary
                bike in cycling position for extended periods and had poor form.
                The rower was the primary apparatus on the previous phase and
                did not contribute to any symptoms. I implemented a stretching
                plan into my schedule and gradually the pain subsided.</li>

            <li><strong>Overly optimistic endurance pace selection</strong>.
                Phase 2, Polarisation, requires selection of an
                <i>endurance&nbsp; pace</i>, which is held as a minimum pace
                during Polarisation workouts. It is described by Matt as:
                <blockquote>
                Endurance pace may be best understood like this: Your friend
                enters the gym and walks over to say hello.  You have sufficient
                oxygen such that you can say a quick hello, ask him politely how
                it's going, but cannot carry on a conversation of any length.
                </blockquote>
                My initial endurance pace estimate was too fast, and as
                workouts became longer, it was more difficult to hold onto
                pace. I took too many workouts to realise this was the
                problem. However once the penny dropped, I used the next couple
                of Polarisation workouts to narrow down the pace to better match
                Matt's description.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-would-change">What I think I would change</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Spread workouts across more apparatus</strong>.
                Throughout the Differentiation and FLUX phases I worked mainly
                on the AirDyne, only doing intervals on the rower and
                occasionally the SkiErg. While the main reasons for this was
                comfort on longer sessions, I suspect balancing out work across
                apparatus would be a more beneficial approach, giving more
                resilience to longer workouts on the rower and SkiErg. Going
                into the second Year of the Engine program, I will try to spread
                the work out more evenly.</li>

            <li><strong>Include some workouts from the MetCon track</strong>.
                I chose to just do the ergometer track, foregoing any
                weightlifting and gymnastics movements. Going into year two I
                will definitely be leaning toward any available MetCon track in
                order to practice and improve other skills, as well as
                incorporate weighted movements.</li>

            <li><strong>Upgrade the air bike</strong>. I used the Schwinn
                AirDyne 6 as my air bike, and aside from showing its age, it
                has no method to accurately track effort and does not recall
                past workouts. I would like to be able to get performance data
                as per the Concept2 rower and SkiErg, some of which is
                visualised in the graphs in this review. If the fates are kind,
                perhaps a Concept2 BikeErg is on the horizon.</li>

        From here on is entirely my opinion. Data is from my results. Feel free to disagree.

        <h3 id="program-review-program-structure">Program Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is simply structured and easy to follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 workouts each week.</li>
            <li>4 weeks' worth of workouts provided at the start of the training
                month.</li>
            <li>3 months per phase.</li>
            <li>4 phases over the entire of year one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Adjustments available to the athlete are similarly simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move workouts around in a week as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Complete all workouts in a week before moving to the next.</li>
            <li>Complete one phase before moving to the next.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Each phase has instructions which are provided with the first month of
        that phase. Each workout is described without superfluous verbage.
        There is virtually no room for over-interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-flexibility">Program flexibility</h3>
        <p>
        While highly structured, the program does provide <i>some</i> flexibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used as a standalone conditioning program;</li>
            <li>It can be scheduled to fit in with an existing training
                schedule;</li>
            <li>Workouts fit a range of apparatus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If you are seeking a program that you can tailor beyond the above, then
        you may be disappointed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-requirements">Program requirements</h3>
        <p>
        While the program is geared towards having access to a rowing machine
        and an air bike, other forms of exercise can be substituted. SkiErg has
        been mentioned, and there are scalings provided for running. Matt has
        also mentioned some athletes choosing swimming for some workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have access to a gym, or are able to run, you will have access to
        at least one form of activity suited to the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-description">Workout description</h3>
        <p>
        Each workout is clear, short, simply stated and unambiguous. 'nuff said.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no warm-up or warm-down specified.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-intensity">Workout intensity</h3>
        <p>
        The intensity of each phase is described in the instructions received
        at the start of that phase. For example, part of the FLUX instructions:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            If you're unable to hit the suggested FLUX pace, that's OK. Go as
            high as you can, provided that you can sustain endurance pace
            between FLUX intervals.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Similarly to the <a href="#program-review-workout-description">workout
            description</a>, instructions on intensity are clear and
        unambiguous.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-target-metric">Workout target metric</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of the 240 workouts in the program, only 8 specify a set distance
        as the workout target metric. That is, 8 workouts are &ldquo;for
        time&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;complete the distance while minimising the
        amount of time working&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other 232 workouts specify a set time as the metric.  These
        workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;, as the goal is to maintain or
        maximise distance in a given time frame. High, <u>sustained</u> effort
        yields reward here.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-duration"></div>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts specify the workout duration
        in the description, so scheduling is easy. &ldquo;For time&rdquo;
        workouts are less simple to schedule, as the duration of the workout
        relies entirely on how fast you can complete the work.
        </p>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts are also easier to scale across not
        only apparatus, but also athletes. A 3:00.0 effort requires no scaling
        of time between a rower, SkiErg or air bike. Similarly, 3:00.0 for a
        novice and 3:00.0 for an elite are the same domain; only the skill
        level on the apparatus and the intensity brought by the athlete differ.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
            I found &ldquo;for distance&rdquo; workouts yielded much more
            consistent results than past attempts at other programs which
            focused on minimising time, even when working at higher than
            &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; paces.
        </p>
        <p>
        Longer workouts, such as Endurance, warn against unbalanced effort:
        </p>
        <img class="centre"
             src="images/consistent-pace-do-not-sprint.png"
             alt="consistent pace do not sprint" />

        <p class="self">
        I balanced the urge to sprint is with the knowledge that the time domain is
        fixed: sprinting too early would result in limping home, yielding an
        inconsistent pace. Not what the workout is asking for.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is definitely the right time and place in the program to sprint:
        the speed and threshold Interval workouts require effort at and above
        race pace, time trials by definition are sprints, and the Polarisation
        and FLUX workouts will truly test your mettle with sustained,
        above-&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; speeds with even faster bursts.
        </p>
        <p>
        Conditioning can be considered the result of repeated, sustained effort

        <p>
        Workout types are different day-to-day in a workout week. However, the
        last workout type from the previous week may start the new week off.
        Overall the workouts are spread well, and as mentioned previously, the
        athlete may move them around within a workout week to suit.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-spread-scatter"></div>

        <p>
        Interval workouts dominate phase 1. Phase 2 reduces Interval workouts,
        balancing them with the introduction of Polarisation and steady
        Endurance work. Phase 3 maintains Intervals, reduces Polarisation and
        slighly increases Endurance. The program ends in phase 4 with emphasis
        on FLUX workouts.

        Daily workout duration did increase over the length of the program.
        Intervals and FLUX remained around 30:00, Endurance and Polarisation

        Each workout is variation on the theme of the workout type - Intervals
        are interleaved periods of work and rest, Endurance is long &ldquo;steady
        state&rdquo;, Polarisation is shorter-length endurance but with bursts
        of max effort, and so on. As such, while each workout changes in it's
        details, the theme of each type of workout remain consistent throughout
        the program.

        <p>
        Apparatus choice is a variable in the program. My chosen apparatus

        <p>
        At times the program felt <i>grindy</i> - a lot of time, a lot of
        sweat, with the only difference between like-themed workouts being a
        small detail.  The time trials are in phases 1 and 3, so at times it's
        difficult to gauge how you are progressing in phases 2 and 4.
        </p>
        <p>
        But there is magic here. Or rather, <strong>intent</strong>. A closer
        examination of individual workouts in each workout type across an entire
        phase show a consistent increase in the variables of duration, rest,
        and intensity. Not huge leaps and bounds, but a regular, steady
        increase. All these small increases put together create a tidy,
        measured and most importantly achievable progression in intensity.
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phase 2, when Polarisation was introduced, to be the most
            physically difficult. The intensity increased, workout length
            increased, and while I felt like I was improving , I had no hard
            data to back it up. This is in contrast to phase 1, where there were
            three time trials to gauge progress.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, after completing phase 2, and specifically after the time
            trials in phase 3, it was more than obvious that the <i>grind</i>
            in phase 2 yielded results.

        Is the program <strong>on the pure capacity track</strong> constantly
        varied?  In the CrossFit sense of &ldquo;constantly varied&rdquo;, no.
        Yet this is on purpose, and the
        <a

        <h3 id="program-review-mental-fortitude">Mental fortitude</h3>
        <p>
        The length of time that you spend each day on the program will test your
        ability to &ldquo;embrace the suck.&rdquo; Whether shorter Intervals at
        high number of rounds, or longer Endurance workouts at a sustained pace
        with bursts, all of the workouts require a mental committment to
        complete.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phases 1 and 2 to be the most mentally difficult. Intervals
            never seemed to end, even knowing how long the workout was going to
            be. And with the introduction of Polarisation in phase 2, I was
            spending a lot more time on the bike than I ever had. It was hard
            being in inside my head with no escape for long periods, grinding
            away.
            </p>
            <p>
            Strangely, I found phases 3 and 4 to be less mentally exhausting, as
            my focus shifted toward maintaining sustained output with less (or
            no) rest. Familiarisation with the workouts possibly helped. Could I
            be getting fitter?
            </p>
            <p>
            Bizarrely, workouts in phase 4 became less mentally <i>taxing</i>
            and more mentally <i>challenging</i>. Instead of aiming for
            survival, the emphasis changed to something like a game -
            how close to pace I could stay while pushing a bit harder on the max
            bursts? This phase almost became fun.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="program-review-recovery">Recovery</h3>
        <p>
        The program doesn't dictate what recovery should be or when it should
        occur. The opening month is 4 working days per week, with a fifth day
        being optional. From the second month, 5 workouts are to be completed
        per week. It is assumed that the athlete would listen well to their
        body, and determine the right time to rest and recover.
        </p>
        <p>
        The apparatus suggested by the program are largely non-impact, reducing
        the need for the body to absorb significant shocks for extended periods,
        in turn reducing the amount of soreness and time needed for recovery.
        Running is the exception; care should be taken when choosing which
        workouts, and how to recover.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            On a few occasions I did six days in a row with no soreness or
            ill-effect.

            <p>
            However, <a href="#reflection-what-i-got-wrong">a lack of stretching

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is a program designed to improve cardiovascular
        capacity. I completed the first year, following the instructions as
        provided, and demonstrated significant improvements in the 10:00.0 air
        bike time trial, stayed within 5% of competition paces for 500m and 2k
        indoor rowing events with no specific preparation, and had no reduction
        in MetCon ability.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program is administered simply. A monthly email provides workouts
        for the month. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. The
        rationale and reasoning behind the program are public and easy to
        digest.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program does not discriminate against the novice, intermediate or
        advanced athlete. Workouts are overwhelmingly fixed duration, so
        intensity is left entirely to the athlete to determine. Guidance is
        provided for intensity for each workout type.
        </p>
        <p>
        Support is readily available from the program author. A group to discuss
        the program is available for those doing the program.
        </p>

        <h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            If you want to improve capacity, this is an excellent program to follow.
            As a beyond-novice-but-not-a-fully-intermediate exerciser, with limited
            time to train and regular day-to-day stresses and interruptions, I found
            the program readily accessible, schedule-forgiving and physically and
            mentally challenging. And I did get capacity gains, as demonstrated
            by my results.
            </p>
            <p>
            I feel novices would benefit greatly from this program as it has a
            very simple structure, is well documented and unambiguous. Get familiar
            with the apparatus first and make time for recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Intermediate athletes would discover, particularly in phase 1, where
            the holes in their fitness are. The remainder of the program will
            fill those holes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Advanced and elites would be pushed beyond their limits. Phase 2 and
            3 would be an opportunity for them to drastically improve their
            mental game.
            </p>
            <p>
            I thoroughly enjoyed year one of Year of the Engine and am looking
            forward to year two.
