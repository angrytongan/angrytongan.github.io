        <h1>Year of the Engine Program Review - Year 1</h1>

        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>I completed the first year of <a href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains
            Lab</a> <a href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a>
            capacity program by <a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/thegainslab1/">Matt Wiebke</a>.
            My results show 11% performance improvement in the 10:00 air bike
            time trial, and maintained my pace within 5% of competition pace on
            500m and 2k rowing ergometer time trials. Metabolic conditioning
            performance remained largely unchanged without any specific
            training. I recommend the program if you wish to improve your
            cardiovascular capacity.
        </p>

        <h2 id="about-this-review">About this review</h2>
        <p>
        Whilst going through the program, I would occasionally reflect on my results to
        determine how I was progressing. I realised I had accumulated a significant amount
        of data, and decided to collate this information into this review to give people
        who are interested in the program concrete information in the way of results, as
        well as subjective information in the way of review and opinion.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
        I have worked with The Gains Lab previously, having completed five months of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegainslab.com/dominate">Total
            Domination</a> program prior to starting Year of the Engine. I have
        also done some work on <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains Lab
        website</a>, in exchange for a reduced rate on this program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-approval">Approval</h3>
        <p>
        Prior to publishing, this review was sent to <a
            href="mailto:coach@thegainslab.com">Matt Wiebke</a> from The Gains Lab seeking:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approval to show some workouts from the program;</li>
            <li>Comment on accuracy of how I describe the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Matt's corrections have been included and marked in this review.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        For purposes of discussion, only a few workouts that comprise the
        program are described in detail in this review. All other workout
        descriptions are obfuscated to protect the content of the program. This
        obfuscation is described in more detail <a href="#program-workouts">below</a>.
        </p>

        <!-- program -->
        <h2 id="program">Program</h2>
        <p>
        A broad overview of the program is provided below. More detail is available on <a
            href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab Engine</a> page. Matt also
        gives a good summary <a
             href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/i86gqh/year_of_the_engine_data_from_a_almost_complete/g19kg1f/">on

        </p>

        <h3 id="program-phases">Phases</h3>
        <p>
        The program has four phases. Each phase builds on the work from the
        previous phase, necessitating completing each one before starting the
        next.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>

        </table>

        <h3 id="program-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        The Polarisation and Differentiation phases (months 4 to 9) are split in two
        tracks that you can choose from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure capacity</strong> ergometer only track. Workouts are
                apparatus only.</li>
            <li><strong>MetCon</strong> Metabolic conditioning-style track. Workouts
                utilise multi-movement patterns with varying equipment (eg. barbells,
                dumbbells, wallballs, jump rope, etc)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="program-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        Workouts were received via email each month as a single .pdf file. Each
        file contains four weeks of work, with workouts for five days in the
        week. An exception to this format is the first month of the program, in
        which the fifth workout each week is optional.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each workout is one of the following types:

        <p>
        Each workout can use a different piece of equipment, allowing changing
        apparatus to suit your particular circumstances. Scalings are supplied
        for different apparatus, and the program strongly suggests which machines
        are <i>not</i> suitable for certain workouts.

        <h3 id="methodology-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        As <a href="#program-workouts">previously noted</a>, there are two tracks you
        can choose during the Polarisation and Differentiation phases: pure capacity or
        metabolic conditioning.
        </p>
        <p class="self">
        I chose <strong>pure capacity</strong>. All references to workouts in
        this review will only be for this track, and not for the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
        The program places no restriction on what days workouts are to occur,
        only that each weeks' workouts must be completed before moving to the
        next week.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program deliberately allows you to move workouts around during the week in
        order to fit in with other training and life events.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I tried to do shorter workouts (intervals, time trials) at the start
            of the week, and longer workouts (endurance, polarisation, FLUX) at
            the end of the week and the weekend to fit in with life.
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose not to explicitly schedule rest days, choosing to take a day
            off when tired or if non-training appointments conflicted with
            normal training times.
            </p>
            <p>
            My workouts were predominantly done between 05:00 and 09:00.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="methodology-additional-training">Additional training</h3>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            During the Polarisation and Differentiation phases, I was able to
            fit in strength training of 45 minutes, between two and three times
            per week.  Each workout I would alternate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Back squat, press, deadlift</li>
                <li>Front squat, bench press, pull-ups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            These were for maintenance only, and no effort was made to increase
            load. These workouts were done immediately before the scheduled Year
            of the Engine workout for that day.
            </p>

            <p>
            I completed perhaps a half-dozen MetCon workouts over the course of
            the program, as part of social events and not as part of training. I
            did not do a Year of the Engine workout on these days due to lack of
            time.
            </p>

            <p>
            All other exercise was incidental. This included bike riding,
            a swimming session no more than once every month, playing with
            my kids.

        The .pdf supplied each month has space to write results and specifies

        <p class="self">
        On the rower and SkiErg I used Concept2's <a

        <h3 id="objective-results-biological-markers">Biological markers</h3>
        <p>
        A number of markers were recorded throughout the program:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resting heart rate;</li>
            <li>Blood pressure;</li>
            <li>Haemoglobin count; and</li>
            <li>Weight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        It must be noted that the program is not specifically geared at
        improving any of these markers; however, for untrained individuals it
        would be expected that there would be some changes in these metrics.
        </p>

        <!-- resting heart rate -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-resting-heart-rate">Resting
            heart rate</h4>
        <p>
        Resting heart rate was taken manually by palpation by a nurse as part of
        the plasma donation acceptance criteria in Australia. Heart rate was
        recorded over the course of one minute. This was performed approximately
        every two weeks, except for two occasions when four weeks elapsed between
        recordings.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-restingHeartRate"></div>
        <p>
        There were no significant change in resting heart rate throughout the
        program.
        </p>

        <!-- blood pressure -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-blood-pressure">Blood
            pressure</h4>
        <p>
        Blood pressure was taken by a handheld battery powered blood pressure
        machine by a nurse as part of the plasma donation acceptance criteria in
        Australia. This was performed approximately every two weeks, except for
        two occasions when four weeks elapsed between recordings.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-bloodPressure"></div>
        <p>
        There is some variance here, particularly systolic pressure:
        </p>
        <ol class="space">
            <li>Blood pressure was taken using different handheld battery
                operated machines on each visit. Each of these machines may not
                be calibrated to match each other. Additionally, some machines
                use a medium cuff and others a large cuff which may affect
                results.</li>
            <li>In March 2020, significant changes in employment and
                restrictions in travel were introduced to Australia in order to
                curb the COVID-19 pandemic. This created a huge amount of stress
                for myself and my family, which is reflected in the higher than
                normal systolic readings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Neither of these two possible explanations is related to the program.
        </p>

        <!-- haemoglobin -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-haemoglobin">Haemoglobin
            </h4>
        <p>
        Haemoglobin was measured from a drop of blood taken by fingerprint
        pinprick and examined in a handheld battery operated analyser as part of
        the plasma donation acceptance criteria in Australia. This was performed
        approximately every two weeks, except for two occasions when four weeks
        elapsed between recordings.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-haemoglobin"></div>
        <p>
        There was no significant change in haemoglobin count throughout the
        program.
        </p>

        <!-- weight -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-weight">Weight</h4>
        <p>
        Weight was measured by consumer-grade weigh scales. This was performed
        daily, then three-times weekly, from October 2019 to February 2020, then
        on the same day as plasma donation to coincide with other recorded data.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-weight"></div>
        </p>
        There was no significant change in weight, although there was a spike
        coming into the Christmas period.

        <p>
        From a post I made on <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/fqf4h9/blood_donations_exercise_and_recovery_periods/">/r/crossfit</a>
            in early 2020:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
            Up until end of last year, I would donate plasma on a Saturday
            morning after a workout, then rest until late Sunday afternoon to do
            my next workout - averaging between 30 and 33 hours of rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            Schedule change at start of the year meant donating on Sunday
            morning, resting until Monday morning workout - averaging between 23
            to 25 hours of rest. So a decrease of around 7 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since the schedule change, I've noticed significant drop offs in
            performance in that first workout after donating. The sensation
            during the workout isn't of a fatigue brick, huge drop in energy or
            I-think-I'm-dying; it's more of a "I can't sustain this pace even
            though I should be able to," and so I slow to make it through
            without stopping. Subsequent workouts, spaced at 24-hour periods,
            are fine.
            </p>
            <p>
            All other things being equal, the altered rest period
            seems to affect me significantly, with age no doubt playing a part
            too. Some random Googling turned up this document from NASM
            regarding effects of blood, plasma and platelet donations on
            exercise. There are some papers listed in the reference section
            which were very interesting support material.

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-right">What I believe I got right</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Consistently following the program</strong>. Adherence
                to the program was initially difficult, but once a proper
                schedule was established, and an understanding of the amount of
                effort required to do the first couple of months of the program
                was achieved, it became much easier to follow the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Moving workouts around inside the training
                week</strong>. In order to fit the workouts into my schedule, it
                was necessary to move them within the week rather than strictly
                follow the program. This is provided for in the program. Had I
                tried to do the workouts strictly as written, it would have
                been nearly impossible to fit into my schedule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-wrong">What I know got wrong</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Not stretching</strong>. During the Polarisation phase I
                started getting a lot of lower back, glute and hip flexor pain.
                This was probably caused by an increase of time on the AirDyne
                during this phase; the rower was the primary apparatus on the
                previous phase and did not contribute to any symptoms. I
                implemented a stretching plan into my schedule and gradually the
                pain subsided.</li>

            <li><strong>Overly optimistic endurance pace selection</strong>. The
                Polarisation phase requires selection of an <i>endurance&nbsp;
                pace</i>, which is held as a minimum pace during Polarisation
                workouts. It is described by Matt as:
                <blockquote>
                Endurance pace may be best understood like this: Your friend
                enters the gym and walks over to say hello.  You have sufficient
                oxygen such that you can say a quick hello, ask him politely how
                it's going, but <u>cannot carry on a conversation of any
                    length</u>.
                </blockquote>
                My initial endurance pace estimate was a too fast, and as
                workouts became longer, it was more difficult to hold onto
                pace. It took too many workouts to realise this was the
                problem. However once the penny dropped, I used the next couple
                of Polarisation workouts to narrow down the pace to better match
                Matt's description.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-would-change">What I think I would change</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Spread workouts across more apparatus</strong>.
                Throughout the Differentiation and FLUX phases I worked mainly
                on the AirDyne, only doing intervals on the rower and
                occasionally the SkiErg. While the main reasons for this was
                comfort on longer sessions, I suspect balancing out work across
                apparatus would be a more beneficial approach. Going into the
                second Year of the Engine program, I will be doing more work on
                the rower and SkiErg.</li>

        <h2 id="program-review">Program review</h2>
        <p class="self">
        From here on is entirely my opinon. Feel free to disagree.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-structure">Program Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is simply structured and easy to follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 workouts each week.</li>
            <li>4 weeks' worth of workouts provided at the start of the training
                month.</li>
            <li>3 months per phase.</li>
            <li>4 phases over the entire of year one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Adjustments available to the athlete are similarly simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move workouts around in a week as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Complete all workouts in a week before moving to the next.</li>
            <li>Complete one phase before moving to the next.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Each phase has instructions which are provided with the first month of
        that phase. Each workout is described without superfluous verbage.
        There is virtually no room for over-interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-flexibility">Program flexibility</h3>
        <p>
        While highly structured, the program does provide <i>some</i> flexibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used as a standalone conditioning program;</li>
            <li>It can be scheduled to fit in with an existing training
                schedule;</li>
            <li>Workouts fit a range of apparatus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If you are seeking a program that you can tailor beyond the above, then
        you may be disappointed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-requirements">Program requirements</h3>
        <p>
        While the program is geared towards a minimum of rowing machine and air
        bike, other forms of exercise can be substituted. SkiErg has been
        mentioned, and there are scalings provided for running. Matt has also
        mentioned some athletes choosing swimming for some workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have access to a gym, or are able to run, you will have access to
        at least one form of activity suited to the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-description">Workout description</h3>
        <p>
        Each workout is clear, short, simply stated and unambiguous. 'nuff said.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-intensity">Workout intensity</h3>
        <p>
        The intensity of each phase of the program is clearly described in the
        instructions received at the start of that phase. For example, at the
        start of FLUX:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            As with Polarization, it is critical that you remain at endurance
            pace between FLUX sessions. If you're unable to hit the suggested
            FLUX pace, that's OK. Go as high as you can, provided that you can
            sustain endurance pace between FLUX intervals.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Similarly to the <a href="#program-review-workout-description">workout
            description</a>, instructions on intensity are clearly provided and
        unambiguous.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-duration">Workout duration</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of the 240 workouts in the program, only 8 require covering a set
        distance irrespective of time. That is, 8 workouts are &ldquo;for
        time&rdquo;; complete the workout while minimising the amount of time
        working.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other 232 workouts specify a set time to perform work.
        These workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;, as the goal is to sustain
        or maximise distance in a given time frame. High, <u>sustained</u>
        effort yields reward here.
        </p>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For time&rdquo; workouts are more difficult to schedule, as the
        length of the workout relies entirely on how fast you can complete the
        work.  &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts specify the workout duration
        in the description, so scheduling is much easier.
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found &ldquo;for distance&rdquo; provided much more consistent
            results than past attempts at other programs that focus on distance,
            even when working at higher than &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; paces.
            The urge to sprint is balanced by the knowledge that the time domain
            is fixed: sprinting too early could result in failure to complete
            the workout without limping home. Even the instructions on Endurance
            workouts states:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Consistent pace, do not sprint to finish</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            There are definitely sprint workouts in the program; the speed and
            threshold intervals require working at or above race pace, time trials
            by definition are sprints, and the Polarisation and FLUX workouts will
            truly test your mettle with sustained, above-&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;
            speeds.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        Conditioning can be considered the result of repeated, sustained effort
        <u>over time</u>. More than that, there are physiological reasons for
           sustained efforts, which is the most likely explanation as to why the
           majority of workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;. <a
            href="https://www.thegainslab.com/conditioning">More information
            here</a>.
        </p>
        
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-constantly-varied">Constantly varied?</h3>
        <p>
        Each workout type is variation on a theme - intervals are periods of
        work and rest, endurance is long &ldquo;steady state&rdquo;,
        Polarisation is steady with bursts of max effort and so on. As such,
        while the content of each workout will change, each workout type theme
        remains consistent throughout the program.
        </p>
        <p>
        At times, this can make the program feel like <i>one huge grind</i> -
        a lot of time, a lot of sweat, with the only difference between
        like-themed workouts being a small detail.  I found phase 2, when
        Polarisation was introduced, to be the hardest. A lot of time, and a lot
        of distance, for what seemed to be marginal returns. No time trials in
        there either, so I had no benchmark to work against.
        </p>
        <p>
        But there is <strong>magic</strong> here. Or rather, science. A closer
        examination of individual workouts in each workout type show a gentle
        increase in intensity. Not huge leaps and bounds, but a regular, steady
        increase. All these small increases put together create a tidy, measured
        and most importantly <strong>achievable</strong> progression in intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
        I showed novice gains in phase 1: 6% across the three 10:00 air bike
        test. In phase 3, these tests were repeated, and sure enough, I again
        increased, this time by 5%. And like phase 1, the three tests were
        just part of the program, not something to prepare for specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
        Is the program constantly varied? No, not in the CrossFit sense of
        &ldquo;constantly varied&rdquo;. Well, the MetCon workouts are varied,
        but I chose the pure capacity track. Yet this is on purpose, and the
