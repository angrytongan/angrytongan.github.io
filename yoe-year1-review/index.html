        <h1>Year of the Engine Program Review - Year 1</h1>

        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>I completed the first year of <a href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains
            Lab</a> <a href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a>
            capacity program by <a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/thegainslab1/">Matt Wiebke</a>.
            My results show 11% performance improvement in the 10:00 air bike
            time trial, and maintained my pace within 5% of competition pace on
            500m and 2k rowing ergometer time trials. Metabolic conditioning
            performance remained largely unchanged without any specific
            training. I recommend the program if you wish to improve your
            cardiovascular capacity.

        <h2 id="about-this-review">About this review</h2>
        <p>
        Whilst going through the program, I would occasionally reflect on my results to
        determine how I was progressing. I realised I had accumulated a significant amount
        of data, and decided to collate this information into this review to give people
        who are interested in the program concrete information in the way of results, as
        well as subjective information in the way of review and opinion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        Any notes inside a box like this is something about what I did.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
        I have worked with The Gains Lab previously, having completed five months of the
        <a href="https://www.thegainslab.com/dominate">Total Domination</a> program prior
        to starting Year of the Engine. I have also done some work on <a
            href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains Lab website</a>, in exchange for a
        reduced rate on this program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-approval">Approval</h3>
        <p>
        Prior to publishing, this review was sent to <a
            href="mailto:coach@thegainslab.com">Matt Wiebke</a> from The Gains Lab seeking:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approval to show some workouts from the program;</li>
            <li>Comment on accuracy of how I describe the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Matt's corrections have been included and marked in this review.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        For purposes of discussion, only a few workouts that comprise the program are
        described in detail. All other workout descriptions are obfuscated to protect the
        content of the program. This obfuscation is described in more detail
        <a href="#program-workouts">below</a>.
        </p>

        <!-- program -->
        <h2 id="program">Program</h2>
        <p>
        A broad overview of the program is provided below. More detail is available on <a
            href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab Engine</a> page. Matt also
        gives a good summary <a
             href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/i86gqh/year_of_the_engine_data_from_a_almost_complete/g19kg1f/">on

        </p>

        <h3 id="program-phases">Phases</h3>
        <p>
        The program has four phases. Each phase builds on the work from the
        previous phase, necessitating completing each one before starting the
        next.
        </p>

        </table>

        <h3 id="program-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        The Polarisation and Differentiation phases (months 4 to 9) are split in two
        tracks that you can choose from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure capacity</strong> ergometer only track. Workouts are
                apparatus only.</li>
            <li><strong>MetCon</strong> Metabolic conditioning-style track. Workouts
                utilise multi-movement patterns with varying equipment (eg. barbells,
                dumbbells, wallballs, jump rope, etc)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="program-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        Workouts were received via email each month as a single .pdf file. Each
        file contains four weeks of work, with workouts for five days in the
        week. An exception to this format is the first month of the program, in
        which the fifth workout each week is optional.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each workout is one of the following types:
        </p>
        <table>

        The program as supplied gives options for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rowing on the Concept2 indoor rowing machine or similar;</li>
            <li>Skiing on the Concept2 indoor SkiErg or similar;</li>

        <p>
        Eqiupment choice is permitted to vary on a workout-to-workout basis.
        Scalings are supplied for different machines, and the program strongly
        suggests which machines are not suitable for certain workouts.

        <h3 id="program-additional-training">Additional Training</h3>
        <p>
        The program can be run as standalone or in addition to other training.
        Integration with other training is left to the athlete to manage.

        As described in <a href="#program-workouts">Workouts</a>, there are two tracks you

        The program places no restriction on when workouts are to occur, only that each
        weeks' workouts must be completed before moving to the next week.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program deliberately allows you to move workouts around during the week in
        order to fit in with other training and life events.

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I tried to do shorter workouts (intervals, time trials) at the start
            of the week, and longer workouts (endurance, polarisation, FLUX) at
            the end of the week and on the weekend to fit in with life.

            I chose not to explicitly schedule rest days, choosing to take a day
            off when tired or if non-training appointments conflicted with
            normal training times.

            I was able to fit in strength training of 45 minutes, between two
            and three times per week, during the Polarisation and
            Differentiation phases. Each workout I would alternate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Back squat, press, deadlift</li>
                <li>Front squat, bench press, pull-ups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            These were for strength maintenance only, and no effort was made to
            increase load. Strength sessions were done immediately before the
            scheduled Year of the Engine workout for that day.
            </p>

            <p>
            All other exercise was incidental. This included bike riding,
            a swimming session no more than once every month, playing with
            my kids. I completed less than a dozen MetCon sessions over the
            course of the program.

        <h3 id="methodology-recording-results">Recording results</h3>
        <p>
        The .pdf supplied each month has space to write results and specifies
        what to record for each workout. Matt suggests printing out each sheet
        and recording results in this fashion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        On the rower and SkiErg I used Concept2's <a
            href="https://concept2.com/ergdata">ErgData</a>
        application to record each session. The AirDyne lacks automated
        recording, so I took a photo at the end of each workout and tabled the
        results in a spreadsheet.
