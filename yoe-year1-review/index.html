        <h1>Year of the Engine Program Review - Year 1</h1>

        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>I completed the first year of <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains
            Lab</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a>
            capacity program by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegainslab1/">Matt Wiebke</a>.
            My results show <a href="#objective-results-performance-10-minute-air-bike">
            11% performance improvement in the 10:00.0 air bike
            time trial</a>, and maintained my pace within 5% of competition pace on
            500m and 2k rowing ergometer time trials. Metabolic conditioning
            performance remained largely unchanged without any specific
            training. I recommend the program if you wish to improve your
            cardiovascular capacity.

        <h2 id="about-this-review">About this review</h2>
        <p>
        Whilst going through the Year of the Engine program, I would
        occasionally reflect on my results to determine how I was progressing. I
        realised I had accumulated a significant amount of data which is
        collated into this review. My hope is to give people who are interested
        in the program concrete information in the way of results, as well as
        subjective information in the way of review and opinion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        A box like this describes a decision, experience or an observation that I
        made while on the program.

        <h3 id="about-this-review-disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
        I have worked with The Gains Lab previously, having completed five months of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegainslab.com/dominate">Total
            Domination</a> program about 9 months prior to starting Year of the
        Engine. I have also done some behind-the-scenes work on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains Lab
            website</a>, in exchange for a reduced rate on this program.
        </p>

        Prior to publishing, this review was sent to <a
            href="mailto:coach@thegainslab.com">Matt Wiebke</a> from The Gains Lab seeking:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">Workout obfuscation</h3>
        <p>
        For purposes of discussion, only a few workouts that comprise the
        program are described in detail in this review. All other workout
        descriptions are obfuscated to protect the content of the program. This
        obfuscation is described in more detail <a href="#program-workouts">below</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-data">Data</h3>
        <p>
        The results and graphs presented in this review come directly from data
        collected throughout the program. The raw data is <a
            href="charts/data.js">available here</a>.
        </p>

        <!-- program -->
        <h2 id="program">Program Overview</h2>
        <p>
        A broad overview of the program is provided below. More detail is available on <a
            href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab Engine</a> page. Matt also
        gives a good summary <a
             href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/i86gqh/year_of_the_engine_data_from_a_almost_complete/g19kg1f/">on
             this /r/crossfit thread</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-phases">Phases</h3>
        <div id="graph-phases"></div>
        <p>
        The program has four phases. Each phase builds on the work from the
        previous phase, necessitating completing each one before starting the
        next.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>
                <th>Focus</th>

        </table>

        <h3 id="program-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <div id="graph-tracks"></div>
        <p>
        The Polarisation and Differentiation phases (months 4 to 9) are split in two
        tracks that you can choose from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure capacity</strong> ergometer only track. Workouts are
                apparatus only.</li>
            <li><strong>MetCon</strong> Metabolic conditioning-style track. Workouts
                utilise multi-movement patterns with varying equipment (eg. barbells,
                dumbbells, wallballs, jump rope, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        It is possible to mix and match between tracks, and change tracks
        between phases.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        Workouts were received via email each month as a single .pdf file. Each
        file contains four weeks of workouts, each week having five workouts to
        complete.
        </p>
        <p>
        An exception to this format is the first month of the program, in
        which the fifth workout in each week is optional.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workout-types">Workout types</h3>
        <div id="graph-workout-types"></div>
        <p>
        Each workout type is described below. As <a
             href="#about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">mentioned above</a>, only a
        select number of workouts are described in full in this document; all
        other workout descriptions are obfuscated according to the rules below.

        The program as supplied gives options for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rowing on the Concept2 indoor rowing machine or similar;</li>
            <li>Skiing on the Concept2 indoor SkiErg or similar;</li>
            <li>Biking on the Assault Bike, Echo Bike, BikeErg, AirDyne or
                similar; and</li>
            <li>Running.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Each workout can use a different piece of equipment, allowing changing
        apparatus to suit your particular circumstances. Scalings are supplied
        for different apparatus, and the program strongly suggests which machines
        are <i>not</i> suitable for certain workouts.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-additional-training">Additional Training</h3>
        <p>
        The program can be run as standalone or in addition to other training.
        Integration with other training is left to the athlete to manage.

        <h3 id="methodology-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        As <a href="#program-workouts">previously noted</a>, there are two tracks you
        can choose during the Polarisation and Differentiation phases: pure capacity or
        metabolic conditioning.
        </p>
        <p class="self">
        I chose <strong>pure capacity</strong>. All references to workouts in
        this review will only be for this track, and not for the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
        The program places no restriction on what days workouts are to occur,
        only that each weeks' workouts must be completed before moving to the
        next week.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program deliberately allows you to move workouts around during the week in
        order to fit in with other training and life events.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I tried to do shorter workouts (intervals, time trials) at the start
            of the week, and longer workouts (endurance, polarisation, FLUX) at
            the end of the week and the weekend to fit in with life. Sorta worked.
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose not to explicitly schedule rest days, taking a day off when
            tired or if non-training appointments conflicted with normal
            training times.
            </p>
            <p>
            My workouts were predominantly done between 05:00 and 09:00.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="methodology-additional-training">Additional training</h3>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            During the Polarisation and Differentiation phases, I was able to
            fit in strength training of 45 minutes, between two and three times
            per week. Exercises rotated between back squat, press, deadlift,
            front squat, bench press and pull-ups.  Maintenance weight only;
            loads did not increase. These workouts were done immediately before
            the scheduled Year of the Engine workout for that day.
            </p>

            <p>
            I completed perhaps a half-dozen MetCon workouts over the course of
            the program, as part of social events and not as part of training. I
            did not do a Year of the Engine workout on these days due to lack of
            time.
            </p>

            <p>
            All other exercise was incidental. This included bike riding,
            a swimming session no more than once every month, playing with
            my kids.

        <h3 id="methodology-recording-results">Recording results</h3>
        <p>
        The .pdf supplied each month has space to write results and specifies
        what to record for each workout. Matt suggests printing out each sheet
        and recording results in this fashion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        On the rower and SkiErg I used Concept2's <a
            target="_blank" href="https://concept2.com/ergdata">ErgData</a>
        application to record each session. The AirDyne lacks automated
        recording, so I took a photo of the monitor at the end of each workout
        and tabled the results in a spreadsheet.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-execution">Execution</h3>
        <p>
        I started the program on Monday 16th September 2019, and finished on

        <p>
        The 10:00.0 air bike test is scheduled three times in phase 1 (weeks 4, 8,
        12) and three times in phase 3 (weeks 25, 29, 33). These tests are not
        placed ouside of the workout schedule; they are included as part of
        training. No special preparation was taken for these tests. Warm-up was
        roughly 3-4 minutes at below Endurance pace, 3-4 minutes at Endurance
        pace, 1-2 minutes above Endurance pace.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-tt-airdyne"></div>
        <p>
        There was 11.2% increase in calories recorded by the AirDyne monitor
        between the first and last test.
        </p>
        <p class="self">
        All of these tests I classified as RPE 10. The last two tests I did not
        feel the need to collapse on the floor, and sat upright on the bike
        slowly spinning the pedals while recovering.

        <p>
        A number of markers were recorded throughout the program. The program
        does not require recording these, however they were measured regularly
        throughout my time on the program through a <a
            href="#subjective-observations-donating-plasma">non-training
            activity</a>. They are presented here because the data was available.
        </p>
        <p>
        It must be noted that the program does not claim to change any of these
        markers.

        <!-- resting heart rate -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-resting-heart-rate">Resting
            heart rate</h4>
        <p>
        Resting heart rate was taken manually by palpation by a nurse as part of
        the plasma donation acceptance criteria in Australia. Heart rate was
        recorded over the course of one minute. This was performed approximately
        every two weeks, except for two occasions when four weeks elapsed between
        recordings.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-restingHeartRate"></div>
        <p>
        There were no significant change in resting heart rate throughout the
        program.

        <!-- blood pressure -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-blood-pressure">Blood
            pressure</h4>
        <p>
        Blood pressure was taken by a handheld battery powered blood pressure
        machine by a nurse as part of the plasma donation acceptance criteria in
        Australia. This was performed approximately every two weeks, except for
        two occasions when four weeks elapsed between recordings.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-bloodPressure"></div>
        <p>
        There is some variance here, particularly systolic pressure:
        </p>
        <ol class="space">
            <li>Blood pressure was taken using different handheld battery
                operated machines on each visit. Each of these machines may not
                be calibrated to match each other. Additionally, some machines
                use a medium cuff and others a large cuff which may affect
                results.</li>
            <li>In March 2020, significant changes in employment and
                restrictions in travel were introduced to Australia in order to
                curb the COVID-19 pandemic. This created a huge amount of stress
                for myself and my family, which is reflected in the higher than
                normal systolic readings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Neither of these two possible explanations is related to the program.
        </p>

        <!-- haemoglobin -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-haemoglobin">Haemoglobin</h4>
        <p>
        Haemoglobin was measured from a drop of blood taken by fingerprint
        pinprick and examined in a handheld battery operated analyser as part of
        the plasma donation acceptance criteria in Australia. This was performed
        approximately every two weeks, except for two occasions when four weeks
        elapsed between recordings.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-haemoglobin"></div>
        <p>
        There was no significant change in haemoglobin count throughout the
        program.
        </p>

        <!-- weight -->
        <h4 id="objective-results-biological-markers-weight">Weight</h4>
        <p>
        Weight was measured by consumer-grade weigh scales. This was performed
        daily, then three-times weekly, from October 2019 to February 2020, then
        on the same day as plasma donation to coincide with other recorded data.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-weight"></div>
        </p>
        XXX need to clarify this - good argument to calculate SD and graph it
        may be related to more time on the bike?
        There was no significant change in weight, although there was a spike
        coming into Christmas which we will never speak of again. Ahem.

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-workout-approach">Workout approach</h3>
        <p>
        My approach to workouts has changed. The higher-than-comfortable
        sustained "steady state" work from the program has changed my perception
        of the usefulness of fly-and-die. I now temper opening rounds in a
        workout aiming for 100% consistency instead of going too hard early
        and trying to recover on the run.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-rpe">RPE</h3>
        <p>

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_of_perceived_exertion">rating
            of perceived exertion scale</a> (RPE) is a measure of
        <i>perceived</i> exertion of a physical activity. Here are some changes
        in RPE I experienced over the course of the program.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A year ago, holding a 30kph pace on the air bike for 20:00 would be my
            limit at RPE 10. I am now able to hold that for 60:00 at RPE 7-8.
            </li>
            <li>I completed 15x500m/1:00r in 2018, with RPE 8. I completed it in
                <strong>date here</strong> now with RPE 6-7.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-technique-changes">Technique changes</h3>
        <p>
        My &ldquo;skill&rdquo; level on the air bike has significantly improved.
        The cycling motion is now more refined with significantly less lateral
        movement. In particular, bobbing of the head left and right has
        vanished, with torso remaining much more still. These improvements feel
        like I'm putting more energy into the bike rather than it shooting off
        all over the place.
        </p>
        <p>
        Rowing technique hasn't changed very much. I spent a lot of time working
        on the rower before Year of the Engine (including <a
         href="https://thepeteplan.wordpress.com/the-pete-plan/">The Pete Plan</a> and <a

            Jon Plan</a> for a while), and while not perfect, I am happy
        with how I operate this apparatus.
        </p>
        <p>
        Operating the SkiErg remains a mystery to me.

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-donating-plasma">Donating plasma</h3>
        <p>
        Part of a post I made on <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/fqf4h9/blood_donations_exercise_and_recovery_periods/">/r/crossfit</a>
            in early 2020:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
            Up until end of last year, I would donate plasma on a Saturday
            morning after a workout, then rest until late Sunday afternoon to do
            my next workout - averaging between 30 and 33 hours of rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            Schedule change at start of the year meant donating on Sunday
            morning, resting until Monday morning workout - averaging between 23
            to 25 hours of rest. So a decrease of around 7 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since the schedule change, I've noticed significant drop offs in
            performance in that first workout after donating. The sensation
            during the workout isn't of a fatigue brick, huge drop in energy or
            I-think-I'm-dying; it's more of a "I can't sustain this pace even
            though I should be able to," and so I slow to make it through
            without stopping. Subsequent workouts, spaced at 24-hour periods,
            are fine.
            </p>
            <p>
            All other things being equal, the altered rest period
            seems to affect me significantly, with age no doubt playing a part
            too. Some random Googling turned up

            <li><strong>Followed the program</strong>. Adherence
                to the program was initially difficult, but once a proper
                schedule was established, and an understanding of the amount of
                effort required to complete the first couple of months was
                achieved, it became much easier to follow the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Moved workouts around inside the training

                follow the program. This is provided for in the program. Had I

            <li><strong>Rested only when necessary, not more</strong>. I explicitly
                chose not schedule rest days into my week, instead opting to
                rest when tired or when non-training events prevented training.
                This worked well; some weeks I would do 6 days in a row,
                starting the next weeks' training early. Other weeks life would
                get in the way and I might miss a few days in a row. I feel if I
                had tried to stick hard to a schedule, I would have missed a lot
                more days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-wrong">What I know got wrong</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Not stretching</strong>. During the Polarisation phase I
                started getting a lot of lower back, glute and hip flexor pain.
                This was probably caused by an increase of time on the AirDyne
                during this phase; the rower was the primary apparatus on the
                previous phase and did not contribute to any symptoms. I
                implemented a stretching plan into my schedule and gradually the
                pain subsided.</li>

            <li><strong>Overly optimistic endurance pace selection</strong>. The
                Polarisation phase requires selection of an <i>endurance&nbsp;
                pace</i>, which is held as a minimum pace during Polarisation
                workouts. It is described by Matt as:
                <blockquote>
                Endurance pace may be best understood like this: Your friend
                enters the gym and walks over to say hello.  You have sufficient
                oxygen such that you can say a quick hello, ask him politely how
                it's going, but <u>cannot carry on a conversation of any
                    length</u>.
                </blockquote>
                My initial endurance pace estimate was too fast, and as
                workouts became longer, it was more difficult to hold onto
                pace. I took too many workouts to realise this was the
                problem. However once the penny dropped, I used the next couple
                of Polarisation workouts to narrow down the pace to better match
                Matt's description.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-would-change">What I think I would change</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Spread workouts across more apparatus</strong>.
                Throughout the Differentiation and FLUX phases I worked mainly
                on the AirDyne, only doing intervals on the rower and
                occasionally the SkiErg. While the main reasons for this was
                comfort on longer sessions, I suspect balancing out work across
                apparatus would be a more beneficial approach, giving more
                resilience to longer workouts on the rower and SkiErg. Going
                into the second Year of the Engine program, I will try to spread
                the work out more evenly.</li>

            <li><strong>Upgrade the air bike</strong>. I used the Schwinn
                AirDyne 6 as my air bike, and aside from showing its age, it
                has no method to accurately track effort and does not recall
                past workouts. I would like to be able to get performance data
                as per the Concept2 rower and SkiErg, some of which is
                visualised in the graphs in this review. If the fates are kind,
                perhaps a Concept2 BikeErg is on the horizon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="program-review">Program review</h2>
        <p class="self">
        From here on is entirely my opinion. Data is from my results. Feel free to disagree.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-structure">Program Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is simply structured and easy to follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 workouts each week.</li>
            <li>4 weeks' worth of workouts provided at the start of the training
                month.</li>
            <li>3 months per phase.</li>
            <li>4 phases over the entire of year one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Adjustments available to the athlete are similarly simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move workouts around in a week as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Complete all workouts in a week before moving to the next.</li>
            <li>Complete one phase before moving to the next.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Each phase has instructions which are provided with the first month of
        that phase. Each workout is described without superfluous verbage.
        There is virtually no room for over-interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-flexibility">Program flexibility</h3>
        <p>
        While highly structured, the program does provide <i>some</i> flexibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used as a standalone conditioning program;</li>
            <li>It can be scheduled to fit in with an existing training
                schedule;</li>
            <li>Workouts fit a range of apparatus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If you are seeking a program that you can tailor beyond the above, then
        you may be disappointed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-requirements">Program requirements</h3>
        <p>
        While the program is geared towards having access to a rowing machine
        and an air bike, other forms of exercise can be substituted. SkiErg has
        been mentioned, and there are scalings provided for running. Matt has
        also mentioned some athletes choosing swimming for some workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have access to a gym, or are able to run, you will have access to
        at least one form of activity suited to the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-description">Workout description</h3>
        <p>
        Each workout is clear, short, simply stated and unambiguous. 'nuff said.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no warm-up or warm-down specified.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-intensity">Workout intensity</h3>
        <p>
        The intensity of each phase of the program is clearly described in the
        instructions received at the start of that phase. For example, from the
        instructions at the start of FLUX:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            As with Polarization, it is critical that you remain at endurance
            pace between FLUX sessions. If you're unable to hit the suggested
            FLUX pace, that's OK. Go as high as you can, provided that you can
            sustain endurance pace between FLUX intervals.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Similarly to the <a href="#program-review-workout-description">workout
            description</a>, instructions on intensity are clearly provided and
        unambiguous.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-target-metric">Workout target metric</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of the 240 workouts in the program, only 8 specify a set distance
        as the workout target metric. That is, 8 workouts are &ldquo;for
        time&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;complete the distance while minimising the
        amount of time working&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other 232 workouts specify a set time as the metric.  These
        workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;, as the goal is to maintain or
        maximise distance in a given time frame. High, <u>sustained</u> effort
        yields reward here.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-duration"></div>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts specify the workout duration
        in the description, so scheduling is easy. &ldquo;For time&rdquo;
        workouts are less simple to schedule, as the length of the workout
        relies entirely on how fast you can complete the work.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also in favour of &ldquo;for distance&rdquo; workouts are easier scaling
        across not only apparatus, but also athletes. A 3:00.0 effort requires
        no scaling of time between a rower, SkiErg or air bike. Similarly,
        3:00.0 for a novice and 3:00.0 for an elite are the same domain; only
        the skill level on the apparatus and the intensity brought by the
        athlete will differ.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
            I found &ldquo;for distance&rdquo; workouts yielded much more
            consistent results than past attempts at other programs which
            focused on minimising time, even when working at higher than
            &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; paces.
        </p>
        <p>
        Longer workouts, such as Endurance, warn against unbalanced effort:
        </p>
        <img class="centre"
             src="images/consistent-pace-do-not-sprint.png"
             alt="consistent pace do not sprint" />

        <p class="self">
        I balanced the urge to sprint is with the knowledge that the time domain is
        fixed: sprinting too early would result in limping home, yielding an
        inconsistent pace. Not what the workout is about.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is definitely the right time and place in the program to sprint:
        the speed and threshold Interval workouts require effort at and above
        race pace, time trials by definition are sprints, and the Polarisation
        and FLUX workouts will truly test your mettle with sustained,
        above-&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; speeds with even faster bursts.
        </p>
        <p>
        Conditioning can be considered the result of repeated, sustained effort
        <u>over time</u>. More than that, there are physiological reasons for
           sustained efforts, which is the most likely explanation as to why the
           majority of workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;. <a

        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <p>
        Workout types are different day-to-day in a workout week. However, the
        last workout type from the previous week may start the new week off.
        Overall the workouts are spread well, and as mentioned previously, the
        athlete may move them around within a workout week to suit.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-spread-scatter"></div>

        <p>
        Interval workouts dominate phase 1. Phase 2 reduces Interval workouts,
        balancing them with the introduction of Polarisation and steady
        Endurance work. Phase 3 maintains Intervals, reduces Polarisation and
        slighly increases Endurance. The program ends in phase 4 with emphasis
        on FLUX workouts.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-spread-pies"></div>

        <h3 id="program-review-time-commitment">Time commitment</h3>

        <p>
        The amount of time spent on the program varies depending on the workout
        on for day.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-time-commitment"></div>
        <p>
        Daily workout duration did increase over the length of the program.
        Intervals and FLUX remained around 30:00, Endurance and Polarisation
        workouts gradually increased in duration, capping at an hour.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-constantly-varied">Constantly varied?</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each workout is variation on the theme of the workout type - Intervals
        are interleaved periods of work and rest, Endurance is long &ldquo;steady
        state&rdquo;, Polarisation is shorter-length endurance but with bursts
        of max effort, and so on. As such, while each workout changes in it's
        details, the theme of each type of workout remain consistent throughout
        the program.
        </p>
        <p>
        My chosen apparatus vs time below:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-constantly-varied-summary"></div>
        <p>
        At the program felt <i>grindy</i> - a lot of time, a lot of sweat, with
        the only difference between like-themed workouts being a small detail.
        The time trials are in phases 1 and 3, so at times it's difficult to
        gauge how you are progressing without in phases 2 and 4.
        </p>
        <p>
        But there is magic here. Or rather, <strong>intent</strong>. A closer
        examination of individual workouts in each workout type across an entire
        phase show a consistent increase in the variables of duration, rest,
        and intensity. Not huge leaps and bounds, but a regular, steady
        increase. All these small increases put together create a tidy,
        measured and most importantly <strong>achievable</strong> progression
        in intensity.
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phase 2, when Polarisation was introduced, to be the most
            physically difficult. The intensity increased, workout length
            increased, and while I felt like I was improving , I had no hard
            data to back it up. This is in contrast to phase 1, where there were
            three time trials to gauge progress.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, after completing phase 2, and specifically after the time
            trials in phase 3, it was more than obvious that the <i>grind</i>
            in phase 2 yielded results.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        Is the program <strong>on the pure capacity track</strong> constantly
        varied?  In the CrossFit sense of &ldquo;constantly varied&rdquo;, no.
        Yet this is on purpose, and the
        <a

            why is well worth the read</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-mental-fortitude">Mental fortitude</h3>
        <p>
        The length of time that you spend each day on the program will test your
        ability to &ldquo;embrace the suck.&rdquo; Whether shorter Intervals at
        high number of rounds, or longer Endurance workouts at a sustained pace
        with bursts, all of the workouts require a mental committment to
        complete.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phases 1 and 2 to be the most mentally difficult. Intervals
            never seemed to end, even knowing how long the workout was going to
            be. And with the introduction of Polarisation in phase 2, I was
            spending a lot more time on the bike than I ever had. It was hard
            being in inside my head with no escape for long periods, grinding
            away.
            </p>
            <p>
            Strangely, I found phases 3 and 4 to be less mentally exhausting, as
            my focus shifted toward maintaining sustained output with less (or
            no) rest. Familiarisation with the workouts possibly helped. Could I
            be getting fitter?
            </p>
            <p>
            Bizarrely, workouts in phase 4 became less mentally <i>taxing</i>
            and more mentally <i>challenging</i>. Instead of aiming for
            survival, the emphasis changed to something like a game -
            how close to pace I could stay while pushing a bit harder on the max
            bursts? This phase almost became fun.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="program-review-recovery">Recovery</h3>
        <p>
        The program doesn't dictate when recovery should occur. The opening
        month is 4 working days per week, with a fifth day being optional. From
        the second month, 5 workouts are to be completed per week. It is assumed
        that the athlete would listen well to their body, and determine the
        right time to rest and recover.
        </p>
        <p>
        The apparatus suggested by the program are largely non-impact, reducing
        the need for the body to absorb significant shocks for extended periods,
        in turn reducing the amount of soreness and time needed for recovery.
        Running is the exception; care should be taken when choosing which
        workouts, and how to recover.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            On a few occasions I did six days in a row with no soreness or
            ill-effect.
