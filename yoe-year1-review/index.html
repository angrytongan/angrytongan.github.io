                href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a>
                capacity program by <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/thegainslab1/">Matt Wiebke</a>.
                The results of each workout were recorded. Tests were performed
                during the program and after it was completed which showed significant
                improvement in capacity, workout execution and consistency of effort
                across a range of workouts. I recommend the program if you wish to
                improve your cardiovascular capacity.

        <h2 id="about-this-review">About this review</h2>
        <p>
        Whilst going through the Year of the Engine program, I would
        occasionally reflect on my results to determine how I was progressing. I
        realised I had accumulated a significant amount of data which is
        collated into this review. My hope is to give people who are interested
        in the program concrete information in the way of results, as well as
        subjective information in the way of review and opinion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        A box like this describes a decision, experience or an observation that I
        made while on the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
        I have trained with The Gains Lab previously, having completed five
        months of the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.thegainslab.com/dominate">Total Domination</a>
        program about 9 months prior to starting Year of the Engine. I have also
        done some behind-the-scenes work on <a target="_blank"
            href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains Lab website</a>, in
        exchange for a reduced rate on this program.
        </p>
        <p>
        This review is unsolicited.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-approval">Approval</h3>
        <p>
        Prior to publishing, this review was sent to <a
            href="mailto:coach@thegainslab.com">Matt Wiebke</a> from The Gains Lab seeking:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approval to show some specific workouts from the program;</li>
            <li>Comment on accuracy of how I describe the program.</li>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">Workout obfuscation</h3>
        <p>
        For purposes of discussion, selected workouts that comprise the program
        are described in detail in this review. All other workout descriptions
        are obfuscated to protect the content of the program. This obfuscation
        is described in more detail <a href="#program-workouts">below</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-data">Data</h3>
        <p>
        The results and graphs presented in this review come directly from data
        collected throughout the program. The raw workout-by-workout result data
            is <a target="_blank" href="charts/data.js">available here</a>. Stroke data
        information for specific rower and SkiErg workouts were sourced from
        my account on the <a target="_blank" href="https://log.concept2.com">Concept2
            Logbook</a>; links are provided where referenced.

        <p>
        A broad overview of the program is provided below. More detail is available on <a
            target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab
            Engine</a> page. Matt also
        gives a good summary <a

        </p>

        <h3 id="program-phases">Phases</h3>
        <div id="graph-phases"></div>
        <p>
        The program has four phases. Each phase builds on the work from the
        previous phase, necessitating completing each one before starting the
        next.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>
                <th>Focus</th>
                <th>Months</th>
                <th>Workout&nbsp;types</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Engine Builder</td>

                <td>Intervals, Endurance, Time trials</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Polarisation</td>

                <td>Intervals, Endurance, Polarisation, Time trials</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Intervals, Endurance, Polarisation, FLUX</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3 id="program-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        The Polarisation and Differentiation phases (months 4 to 9) are split in two
        tracks that you can choose from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure capacity</strong> ergometer only track. Workouts are
                apparatus only.</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolic Conditioning (MetCon)</strong> track.
                Workouts utilise multi-movement patterns with varying equipment
                (eg. barbells, dumbbells, wallballs, jump rope, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="graph-tracks"></div>
        <p>
        It is possible to mix and match between tracks, and change tracks
        between phases.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        Workouts were received via email each month as a single .pdf file. Each
        file contains four weeks of workouts, each week having five workouts to
        complete.
        </p>
        <p>
        An exception to this format is the first month of the program, in
        which the fifth workout in each week is optional.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workout-types">Workout types</h3>
        <div id="graph-workout-types"></div>
        <p>
        Each workout type is described below. As <a
             href="#about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">mentioned above</a>, only a
        select number of workouts are described in full in this document; all
        other workout descriptions are obfuscated according to the rules below.

        <h3 id="program-equipment">Equipment</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine uses ergometers. The program as supplied gives options for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rowing on the Concept2 indoor rowing machine or similar;</li>
            <li>Skiing on the Concept2 SkiErg or similar;</li>
            <li>Biking on the Assault Air Bike, Rogue Echo Bike, Concept2
                BikeErg, Schwinn AirDyne or similar; and</li>
            <li>Running.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Each workout can be completed with a different apparatus. Scalings are
        supplied. The program strongly suggests which apparatus are <i>not</i>
        suitable for certain workouts.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-additional-training">Additional Training</h3>
        <p>
        The program can be run as standalone or in addition to other training.
        Integration with other training is left to the athlete to manage.

        </ul>

        <h3 id="methodology-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        As <a href="#program-workouts">previously noted</a>, there are two
        tracks you can choose from during phases 2 and 3: pure capacity or
        metabolic conditioning.
        </p>
        <p class="self">
        I chose <strong>pure capacity</strong>. All references to workouts in
        this review will only be for this track, and not for the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
        The program places no restriction on what days workouts are to occur,
        only that each weeks' workouts are to be completed before moving to the
        next week.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program deliberately allows you to move workouts around during the
        week in order to fit in with other training and life.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I tried to do shorter workouts (intervals, time trials) during the
            week, and longer workouts (endurance, polarisation, FLUX) on the
            weekend to fit in with life.
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose not to explicitly schedule rest days, taking a day off when
            tired or if life conflicted with training.
            </p>
            <p>
            Some workouts were shifted between weeks due to life.
            </p>
            <p>
            My workouts were predominantly done between 05:00 and 09:00, and
            prior to first meal of the day.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="methodology-additional-training">Additional training</h3>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            During phases 2 and 3, I was able to fit in strength training of
            less than 45 minutes, between two and three times per week.
            Exercises rotated between various combinations of back squat, press,
            deadlift, front squat, bench press and pull-ups.  Maintenance
            weights only; loads did not increase. These workouts were done
            immediately before the scheduled Year of the Engine workout for that
            day.
            </p>

            <p>
            I completed perhaps a half-dozen MetCon workouts while doing the
            program, as part of social events and not as part of training. I did
            not do a Year of the Engine workout on these days due to lack of
            time.
            </p>

            <p>
            All other exercise was incidental. This included road and mountain
            bike riding, an occasional swimming session, and  playing with my
            kids.

        <h3 id="methodology-recording-results">Recording results</h3>
        <p>
        The .pdf supplied each month specifies what to record for each workout,
        with space available to write results. Matt suggests printing out each
        sheet and recording directly on the sheet.
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            On the rower and SkiErg I used Concept2's <a
                target="_blank" href="https://concept2.com/ergdata">ErgData</a>
            to record each session, which were then uploaded to the <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://log.concept2.com">Concept2 Logbook</a>. Workout
            information, including stroke data, was extracted using the <a

            </p>
            <p>
            The AirDyne lacks automated recording, so I took a photo of the
            monitor at the end of each workout and tabled the results in a
            spreadsheet.

        <h3 id="methodology-execution">Execution</h3>
        <p>
        I started the program on Monday 16th September 2019, and finished on
        Sunday 13th September, 2020. Workouts, and their phases, were completed
        as below.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-execution-summary"></div>
        <div id="graph-phase-duration"></div>

        <!-- objective results -->
        <h2 id="objective-results">Objective results</h2>
        <p>
        The following workouts are presented as evidence of performance changes
        both during and after year one of the Year of the Engine program. The
        results are mine alone (<i>n</i> = 1).
        </p>

        </p>
        The workouts have been chosen as they are either <i>de-facto</i> tests
        of fitness, have notoriety within the fitness community, or the process
        of doing the workout and investigating the data yielded interesting
        results.
        </p>

        <h3 id="objective-results-10-minute-air-bike">10:00.0
            Air Bike time trial</h3>
        <p>
        The 10:00.0 air bike test is scheduled three times in phase 1 (weeks 4, 8,
        12) and three times in phase 3 (weeks 25, 29, 33). These tests are not
        placed ouside of the workout schedule; they are included as part of
        training. No special preparation was taken for these tests.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-tt-airdyne"></div>

        <p>
        There was 11.2% increase in calories recorded by the AirDyne monitor
        between the first and last test.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            There's not much in the way of exposition for this test. The goal
            each time was to increase number of calories from the previous test,
            and to be as consistent as possible throughout the test.
            </p>
            <p>
            The AirDyne doesn't have any way of recording intra-workout metrics;
            it would have been nice to see where pace changes occurred in order
            to develop a better approach than &ldquo;go fast and hang on&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
            Couldn't quite get to 200cals in the last test.

        <h3 id="objective-results-20-minute-rower">20:00.0
            rower time trial</h3>
        <p>
        The 20:00.0 rower test is scheduled three times in phase 3 (weeks 27,
        31, 35). These tests are not placed outside of the workout schedule;
        they are included as part of training. No special preparation was taken
        for these tests.

        </p>

        <p>
        There was 2.8% increase in calories recorded by the rower monitor
        between the first and last test. Pace increased by 1.4s/500m between
        tests 1 and 2, but only 0.1s/500m between tests 2 and 3.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        Test 3 felt very poor. I was unwell at the end of the previous week and
        was most likely still recovering. While faster than test 1, it was
        equal to test 2. I bonked with less than 4 minutes to go, whereas pace
        was held throughout tests 1 and 2. We can see this by examining the pace
        for each test:

        <p>
        Distance and pace barely improved. Calories were lower in attempt 2,
        again marginally. Stroke rate per interval was lower, resulting in fewer
        total strokes across the workout. There were 9 months between attempts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was attempt 2 an improvement over attempt 1?</li>
            <li>If so, why wasn't it bigger, since 9 months of training had
                elapsed?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Let's start with stroke count, as it sticks out the most. Attempt 2
        recorded 16 fewer strokes. We can see where this happened by looking at
        the number of strokes per interval:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-strokesPerInterval"></div>
        <p>
        Attempt 2 had one less stroke in 16 of the 24 intervals
        compared to the attempt 1. We know the attempt 2 covered further
        distance, so we can make the presumption that <u>distance per stroke
        increased</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
        What is the impact of one fewer stroke per interval over the same
        distance? We can examine distance each interval, and graph by stroke:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-distancePerIntervalAllStrokes"></div>
        <p>
        As attempt 2 drops strokes compared to attempt 1, it's graph
        &ldquo;shifts left&rdquo;, until it is 16 strokes ahead of attempt 1.
        Attempt 2 has completed the same distance as attempt 1, but with fewer
        strokes. And the 16 strokes difference matches our variance previously
        tabled.

        <p>
        So how far apart, in distance, are the attempts each interval?  Using
        attempt 1 as a baseline, we can graph attempt 2's increase or decrease
        in distance per interval:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-distanceDeltaPerInterval"></div>
        <p>
        We can see that compared to attempt 1, attempt 2 started out with a
        large lead in interval 1, continued building through to interval 15,
        then recorded reduced distance in intervals 17 to 24.  We can visualise
        the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; by accumulating this difference each interval:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-bankedDistanceByInterval"></div>
        <p>
        By interval 15, attempt 2 has accumulated a lead of 29m over attempt 1.
        This gain is eroded as the workout continues. The distance remaining in
        attempt 2's bank at the end of the last interval is 7m, which matches
        our variance previously tabled.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, we have yet to determine <i>why</i> the distance discrepancy
        appears. Was attempt 1 slow opening then sped up? Did attempt 2 do the
        opposite? Let's look at pace in each interval.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-pacePerInterval"></div>

        <p>
        The points representing pace for attempt 1 appear to vary more than
        attempt 2. We can look at the distribution of pace for both attempts to
        verify:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-normalDistributionPace"></div>

        <p>
        By grouping the intervals' pace from each attempt, we can see that the
        range of attempt 2 is tighter than attempt 1, demonstrating the
        principle of <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.thegainslab.com/interval-training"><i>maximising
                the average, minimising the range</i></a>:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-rangePace"></div>

        <p>
        Attempt 2 held a <u>more consistent pace</u> per interval than attempt
        1.
        </p>

        <p>
        One last thing to look at is power per stroke:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-wattsPerStroke"></div>

        <p>
        The distribution balances out the spikes:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-normalDistributionWatts"></div>

        <p>
        Attempt 2 generated marginally <u>more power per stroke</u> than attempt
        1, with a slightly improved consistency.
        </p>

        <p>
        Summing up: objectively we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt 2 used fewer strokes to go further.</li>
            <li>Attempt 2 had a lower calorie cost.</li>
            <li>Attempt 2 showed more consistency in pace.</li>
            <li>Attempt 2 showed more power per stroke.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Subjectively, we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt 2 RPE improved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        We can summarise the above points by saying attempt 2 was more
        <strong>efficiently executed</strong> than attempt 1. Attempt 2 yielded
        a marginally better result than attempt 1 at a lower energy cost, and
        demonstrated <strong>improved consistency of effort</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
        But this conclusion does nothing to explain the lack of <u>significant
            improvement</u> given the 9 months of training between attempts. Why?
        </p>

            Occam's razor: I screwed up.
            </p>
            <p>
            When repeating workouts, I check my previous result, consider how
            I'm feeling, predict how much faster I could complete the work and
            use that as my goal. When I checked my history, I accidently looked
            up <strong>2<u>0</u>x0:30/0:30r</strong> (instead of
            2<u>4</u>x0:30/0:30r).
            </p>
            <p>
            20x0:30/0:30r had a pace of 1:40.5. It was done 6 weeks prior to
            attempt 1 of 24x0:30/0:30r.
            </p>
            <p>
            For attempt 2, I conservatively chose 1:39.5, not realising I
            should have been aiming for at least 1:38.3.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the end: attempt 2 had a pace of 1:39.1, an improvement on
            20x0:30/0:30r, an improvement on 24x0:30/0:30r, faster than the goal
            pace set at the start of the workout, and completed with a lowered
            RPE.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        While the on-paper gain was negligible, we could conclude that there was
        improvement between attempts, but instead of bigger / faster / stronger,
        the gain was a <strong>demonstrated increase in ability to hold a
        consistent pace</strong>.

        Let's compare interval pace. The fastest interval in attempt 1 was
        slower than the slowest interval in attempt 2; the fastest interval in
        attempt 2 beat the fastest in attempt 1 by 11 seconds:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-3_2000_300-rangePace"></div>

        <p>
        Comparing each interval by pace shows more consistency and a bigger
        finish in attempt 2:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-3_2000_300-interval-strokedata"></div>

        <p>
        This is backed up by examining the normal distribution of pace for each
        interval. The lack of consistency in the third interval of attempt 2 is
        because of the sprint finish, much faster than attempt 1 but with a
        larger range:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-3_2000_300-interval-normal-distribution"></div>

        <p>
        The stroke rate of attempt 2 was lower than attempt 1 across all
        intervals (excluding the sprint finish). This is reflected in our tabled
        data of 46 fewer strokes over the whole workout, and 2 fewer strokes per
        minute:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-3_2000_300-interval-strokedata-spm"></div>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            Attempt 2 felt no more difficult than attempt 1, but the result was a
            big increase in pace and consistency. I feel that this result is much
            more important than the time trials, as it demonstrates a skill increase
            in managing pace, stroke rate, power delivery and recovery, and not just
            pure grunt increase.
            </p>
            <p>
            It would be interesting to try this test again with a higher stroke
            rate in the last interval.

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-workout-approach">Workout approach</h3>
        <p>
        My approach to workouts has changed. The higher-than-comfortable
        sustained "steady state" work from the program has changed my perception
        of the usefulness of fly-and-die. I now temper opening rounds in a
        workout aiming for 100% consistency instead of going too hard early
        and trying to recover on the run.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-phenomenom-of-fast-finishes">The phenomenom of fast finishes</h3>
        <p>
        While completing phase 1, I started to notice that many of my interval
        results were following a similar pattern: the last interval was usually
        at a higher pace than the previous intervals, with a kick toward the
        end, like below:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-interval.workout_40553854"></div>
        <p>
        Sometimes I couldn't hold the kick all the way to the end of the
        interval, but inexplicibly, my pace stayed above the average for
        that interval, like below:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-interval.workout_41335805"></div>
        <p>
        It's not negative splits, I didn't feel that I sandbagged these
        workouts, and I had chosen paces that I knew I could hold across all
        intervals without going too fast nor slow.

            I feel related to RPE is being able to hold consistent pace on the
            air bike. A year ago, holding 29-30kph on the AirDyne for 20:00 was
            my limit, and rated it RPE 10. I am now able to hold the same pace

        <p>
        My &ldquo;skill&rdquo; level on the air bike has significantly improved.
        The cycling motion is now more refined with significantly less lateral
        movement. In particular, bobbing of the head left and right has
        vanished, with torso remaining much more still and upright. These
        improvements feel like I'm putting more energy into the bike rather
        than away from it.

        Part of a post I made on <a

            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/fqf4h9/blood_donations_exercise_and_recovery_periods/">/r/crossfit</a>
            in early 2020:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        <img

            />

            <p>
            Up until end of last year, I would donate plasma on a Saturday
            morning after a workout, then rest until late Sunday afternoon to do
            my next workout - averaging between 30 and 33 hours of rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            Schedule change at start of the year meant donating on Sunday
            morning, resting until Monday morning workout - averaging between 23
            to 25 hours of rest. So a decrease of around 7 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since the schedule change, I've noticed significant drop offs in
            performance in that first workout after donating. The sensation
            during the workout isn't of a fatigue brick, huge drop in energy or
            I-think-I'm-dying; it's more of a "I can't sustain this pace even
            though I should be able to," and so I slow to make it through
            without stopping. Subsequent workouts, spaced at 24-hour periods,
            are fine.
            </p>
            <p>
            All other things being equal, the altered rest period
            seems to affect me significantly, with age no doubt playing a part
            too. Some random Googling turned up

        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Followed the program</strong>. Adherence
                to the program was initially difficult, but once a proper
                schedule was established, and an understanding of the amount of
                effort required to complete the first couple of months was
                achieved, it became much easier to follow the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Moved workouts around inside the training
                week</strong>. In order to fit the workouts into my schedule, it
                was necessary to move them within the week rather than strictly
                follow the program. This is provided for in the program. Had I
                tried to do the workouts in order as written, it would have
                been nearly impossible to fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Rested by feel, not by schedule</strong>. I
                explicitly chose not schedule rest days into my week, instead
                opting to rest when tired or when non-training events prevented
                training.  This worked well; some weeks I would do 6 days in a
                row, starting the next weeks' training early. Other weeks life
                would get in the way and I might miss a few days in a row. I
                feel if I had tried to stick hard to a schedule, I would have
                missed a lot more training days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-wrong">What I know got wrong</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Insufficient attention to recovery</strong>. During
                phase 2, I started getting a lot of lower back, glute and hip
                flexor pain. This was probably caused by an increase of time on
                the AirDyne during this phase. I was not used to sitting on a
                stationary bike for extended periods and had poor form.  The
                rower was the primary apparatus on the previous phase and did
                not contribute to any symptoms. I added a stretching plan
                into my schedule and gradually the pain subsided.</li>

            <li><strong>Overly optimistic endurance pace selection</strong>.
                Phase 2 requires selection of an <i>endurance&nbsp; pace</i>,
                which is held as a minimum pace during Endurance, Polarisation
                and FLUX workouts. It is described by Matt as:
                <blockquote>
                Your friend enters the gym and walks over to say hello.  You
                have sufficient oxygen such that you can say a quick hello, ask
                him politely how it's going, but cannot carry on a conversation
                of any length.
                </blockquote>
                and:
                <blockquote>
                Pace for endurance days: 7/10 rpe, 70-75% max HR, so as long as
                you’re around there, it’s good work.
                </blockquote>
                My initial endurance pace estimate was too fast, and as
                workouts became longer, it was more difficult to hold onto
                pace. I took too many workouts to realise this was the
                problem. However once the penny dropped, I used the next couple
                of Polarisation workouts to narrow down the pace to better match
                Matt's description.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-would-change">What I think I would change</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Spread workouts across more apparatus</strong>.
                Throughout phases 3 and 4 I worked mainly on the AirDyne, only
                doing intervals on the rower and rarely the SkiErg. While the
                main reasons for this was comfort on longer sessions, I suspect
                balancing out work across apparatus would be a more beneficial
                approach, giving more resilience to longer workouts on the rower
                and SkiErg.</li>

            <li><strong>Include some workouts from the MetCon track</strong>.
                I chose to follow just the ergometer track, foregoing any
                weightlifting and gymnastics movements. No doubt this
                contributed to the feeling of <i>grind</i>. Interspersing
                non-ergometer workouts throught the program would introduce more
                variance and reduce that grindy feeling.
                </li>

            <li><strong>Upgrade the air bike</strong>. I used the Schwinn
                AirDyne 6 as my air bike. Aside from showing its age, it has no
                method to accurately track effort in a workout and does not
                recall past workouts. I would like to be able to get performance
                data as per the Concept2 rower and SkiErg, some of which is
                visualised in the graphs in this review. Perhaps a Concept2
                BikeErg is on the horizon.</li>

        I chose not to do a 2k after the program was done, as the 10:00.0

        we already <a href="#objective-results-10-minute-air-bike">looked at

        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-structure">Program Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is simply structured and easy to follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 workouts each week.</li>
            <li>4 weeks' worth of workouts provided at the start of the training
                month.</li>
            <li>3 months per phase.</li>
            <li>4 phases over the entire of year one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Adjustments available to the athlete are similarly simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move workouts around in a week as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Complete all workouts in a week before moving to the next.</li>
            <li>Complete one phase before moving to the next.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Each phase has instructions which are provided with the first month of
        that phase. Each workout is described without superfluous verbage.
        There is virtually no room for over-interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-flexibility">Program flexibility</h3>
        <p>
        While highly structured, the program does provide some flexibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used as a standalone conditioning program;</li>
            <li>It can be scheduled to fit in with an existing training
                schedule;</li>
            <li>Workouts fit a range of apparatus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program assumes knowledge in how to operate your chosen apparatuses;
        it provides no instruction here.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are seeking a program that you can tailor beyond the above, then
        you may be disappointed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-requirements">Program requirements</h3>
        <p>
        While the program is geared towards having access to a rowing machine
        and an air bike, other forms of exercise can be substituted. SkiErg has
        been mentioned, and there are scalings provided for running. Matt has
        mentioned in the past athletes choosing swimming for some workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have access to a gym, or are able to run, you will have access to
        at least one form of activity suited to the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-description">Workout description</h3>
        <p>
        Each workout is clear, short, simply stated and unambiguous. 'nuff said.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no warm-up or warm-down specified.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-intensity">Workout intensity</h3>
        <p>
        The intensity of each phase is described in the instructions received
        at the start of that phase. For example, part of the FLUX instructions:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            If you're unable to hit the suggested FLUX pace, that's OK. Go as
            high as you can, provided that you can sustain endurance pace
            between FLUX intervals.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Similarly to the <a href="#program-review-workout-description">workout
            description</a>, instructions on intensity are clear and
        unambiguous.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-target-metric">Workout target metric</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of the 240 workouts in the program, only 8 specify a set distance
        as the workout target metric. That is, 8 workouts are &ldquo;for
        time&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;complete the distance while minimising the
        amount of time working&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other 232 workouts specify a set time as the metric.  These
        workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;, as the goal is to maintain or
        maximise distance in a given time frame. High <u>sustainable</u> effort
        yields reward here.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-duration"></div>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts specify the workout duration
        in the description, so scheduling is easy. &ldquo;For time&rdquo;
        workouts are less simple to schedule, as the duration of the workout
        relies entirely on how fast you can complete the work.
        </p>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts are also easier to scale across not
        only apparatus, but also athletes. A 3:00.0 effort requires no scaling
        of time between a rower, SkiErg or air bike. Similarly, 3:00.0 for a
        novice and 3:00.0 for an elite are the same domain; only the skill
        level on the apparatus and the intensity brought by the athlete differ.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
            I found &ldquo;for distance&rdquo; workouts yielded much more
            consistent results than past attempts at other programs which
            focused on minimising time, even when working at higher than
            &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; paces.
        </p>
        <p>
        Longer workouts, such as Endurance, warn against unbalanced effort:
        </p>
        <img class="centre"
             src="images/consistent-pace-do-not-sprint.png"
             alt="consistent pace do not sprint" />

        <p class="self">
        I tempered the urge to sprint with the knowledge that the time domain is
        fixed: sprinting too early would result in limping home, yielding an
        inconsistent pace. Not what the workout is asking for.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is definitely the right time and place in the program to sprint:
        the speed and threshold Interval workouts require effort at and above
        race pace, time trials by definition are sprints, and the Polarisation
        and FLUX workouts will truly test your mettle with sustained,
        above-&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; speeds with even faster bursts.
        </p>
        <p>
        Conditioning can be considered the result of repeated, sustained effort
        <u>over time</u>.  <a

        <h3 id="program-review-time-commitment">Time commitment</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>
        <p>
        The length of a workout depends on the workout type and workout
        specifics for that day.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-time-commitment-summary"></div>
        <p>
        Daily workout duration changes over the course of the program.
        Time trials were 20:00 or less, Intervals and FLUX remained around
        30:00, Endurance and Polarisation workouts gradually increased, capping
        at an hour.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-time-commitment-sd-by-type"></div>

        <h3 id="program-review-constantly-varied">Constantly varied?</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each workout is variation on the theme of the workout type: Intervals
        are interleaved periods of work and rest, Endurance is long &ldquo;steady
        state&rdquo;, Polarisation is shorter-length endurance but with bursts
        of max effort, and so on. As such, while each workout changes in it's
        fine details, the theme of each type of workout remains consistent. We
        can chart workout type across the program to see how they are spread:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-spread-scatter"></div>
        <p>
        The last workout type from the previous week may start the new week off.
        Overall the workout types are spread well, and as mentioned previously,
        the athlete may move them around within a workout week to suit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Interval workouts dominate phase 1. Phase 2 reduces Intervals, balancing
        them with the introduction of Polarisation and steady Endurance work.
        Phase 3 maintains Intervals, reduces Polarisation and slighly increases
        Endurance. The program ends in phase 4 with emphasis on FLUX workouts.

        Apparatus choice is a variable in the program. Here are my chosen
        apparatus against workout duration:

        <p>
        At times the program felt <i>grindy</i> - a lot of time, a lot of
        sweat, with the only difference between like-themed workouts being a
        small detail.  The time trials are in phases 1 and 3, so at times it's
        difficult to gauge how you are progressing in phases 2 and 4.
        </p>
        <p>
        But there is magic here. Or rather, <strong>intent</strong>. A closer
        examination of individual workouts in each workout type across an entire
        phase show a consistent increase in the variables of duration, rest,
        and intensity. Not huge leaps and bounds, but a regular, steady
        increase. All these small increases put together create a tidy,
        measured and most importantly achievable progression in intensity.
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phase 2, when Polarisation was introduced, to be the most
            physically difficult. The intensity increased, workout length
            increased, and while I felt like I was improving I had no hard
            data to back it up. This is in contrast to phase 1, where there were
            three time trials to gauge progress.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, after completing phase 2 - and specifically after the time
            trials in phase 3 - it became overwhelmingly obvious that the
            <i>grind</i> in phase 2 provided the foundation for results in phase
            3 and especially in phase 4.

        Is the program <strong>on the pure capacity track</strong> constantly
        varied?  In the CrossFit sense of &ldquo;constantly varied&rdquo;, no.
        Yet this is on purpose, and the

        <h3 id="program-review-mental-fortitude">Mental fortitude</h3>
        <p>
        The length of time that you spend each day on the program will test your
        ability to &ldquo;embrace the suck.&rdquo; Whether shorter Intervals at
        high number of rounds, or longer Endurance workouts at a sustained pace
        with bursts, all of the workouts require a mental commitment to
        complete.

            I found phases 1 and 2 to be the most mentally difficult. Intervals
            never seemed to end, even knowing how long the workout was going to
            be. Phase 2 workouts meant a lot more time on the bike than ever
            before. It was hard being in inside my head with no escape for long
            periods, grinding away.
            </p>
            <p>
            I found phase 3 to be less mentally exhausting, as focus shifted
            toward maintaining sustained output with less (or no) rest for
            longer periods. Familiarisation with the workouts possibly helped.
            Could I be getting fitter?
            </p>
            <p>
            Bizarrely, workouts in phase 4 became less mentally <i>taxing</i>
            and more mentally <i>challenging</i>. Instead of aiming for
            survival, the emphasis changed to something like a game -
            how close to pace I could stay while pushing a bit harder on the max
            bursts? This phase almost became fun.

        </div>

        <h3 id="program-review-recovery">Recovery</h3>
        <p>
        The program doesn't dictate what recovery should be or when it should
        occur. Workouts are specified five days per seven day week; it would be
        safe to assume that the remaining two days would be allocated to
        recovery, as least from this program.
        </p>
        <p>
        The apparatus suggested by the program are largely non-impact, reducing
        the need for the body to absorb significant shocks for extended periods,
        in turn reducing the amount of soreness and time needed for recovery.
        Running is the exception; care should be taken when choosing which
        workouts to run, and how best to recover.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            At no time was I sore, or unable to do a workout due to a previous
            session.  On a few occasions I did six days in a row with no
            ill-effect.

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is a program designed to improve cardiovascular
        capacity. I completed the first year, following the instructions as
        provided, and demonstrated significant improvements in capacity and
        consistency across interval, endurance and burst workout types.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program is administered simply. A monthly email provides workouts
        for the month. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. The
        rationale and reasoning behind the program are public and easy to
        digest.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program does not discriminate against the novice, intermediate or
        advanced athlete. Workouts are overwhelmingly fixed duration, so
        intensity is left to the athlete to determine, guided by instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
        Support is readily available from the program author. A group to discuss
        the program is available for those doing the program.
        </p>

        <h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            As a beyond-novice-but-not-a-fully-intermediate exerciser, with
            limited time to train and regular day-to-day stresses and
            interruptions, I found the program readily accessible,
            schedule-forgiving and physically and mentally challenging. And I
            did get gains, as demonstrated by my results.
            </p>
            <p>
            I feel novices would benefit greatly from this program as it has a
            very simple structure, is well documented and unambiguous. Get familiar
            with the apparatus first and make time for recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Intermediate athletes would discover, particularly in phase 1, where
            the holes in their capacity are. The remainder of the program will
            serve to fill those holes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Advanced and elites would be pushed beyond their limits. Phases 2 and
            3 would be an opportunity to drastically improve their mental game.
            </p>
            <p>
            I thoroughly enjoyed year one of Year of the Engine.
