        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>I completed the first year of <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains
            Lab</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">Year of the Engine</a>
            capacity program by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegainslab1/">Matt Wiebke</a>.
            My results show <a href="#objective-results-in-program-tests-10-minute-air-bike">
            11% performance improvement in the 10:00.0 air bike
            time trial</a>, and maintained my pace within 5% of competition pace on
            500m and 2k rowing ergometer time trials. Metabolic conditioning
            performance remained largely unchanged without any specific
            training. I recommend the program if you wish to improve your
            cardiovascular capacity.

        <h2 id="about-this-review">About this review</h2>
        <p>
        Whilst going through the Year of the Engine program, I would
        occasionally reflect on my results to determine how I was progressing. I
        realised I had accumulated a significant amount of data which is
        collated into this review. My hope is to give people who are interested
        in the program concrete information in the way of results, as well as
        subjective information in the way of review and opinion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        A box like this describes a decision, experience or an observation that I
        made while on the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-disclosure">Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
        I have worked with The Gains Lab previously, having completed five months of the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegainslab.com/dominate">Total
            Domination</a> program about 9 months prior to starting Year of the
        Engine. I have also done some behind-the-scenes work on
        <a target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com">The Gains Lab
            website</a>, in exchange for a reduced rate on this program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-approval">Approval</h3>
        <p>
        Prior to publishing, this review was sent to <a

        <h3 id="about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">Workout obfuscation</h3>
        <p>
        For purposes of discussion, only a few workouts that comprise the
        program are described in detail in this review. All other workout
        descriptions are obfuscated to protect the content of the program. This
        obfuscation is described in more detail <a href="#program-workouts">below</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="about-this-review-data">Data</h3>
        <p>
        The results and graphs presented in this review come directly from data
        collected throughout the program. The raw data is <a
            href="charts/data.js">available here</a>. Stroke data information
        for individual workouts sourced from my account on the <a
           href="https://log.concept2.com">Concept2 Logbook</a>.

        <!-- program -->
        <h2 id="program">Program Overview</h2>
        <p>
        A broad overview of the program is provided below. More detail is available on <a
            target="_blank" href="https://thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains Lab
            Engine</a> page. Matt also
        gives a good summary <a
            target="_blank"
             href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/i86gqh/year_of_the_engine_data_from_a_almost_complete/g19kg1f/">on
             this /r/crossfit thread</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-phases">Phases</h3>
        <div id="graph-phases"></div>
        <p>
        The program has four phases. Each phase builds on the work from the
        previous phase, necessitating completing each one before starting the
        next.
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>
                <th>Focus</th>
                <th>Months</th>
                <th>Workout&nbsp;types</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Engine Builder</td>
                <td>Imbalance correction</td>
                <td>1, 2, 3</td>
                <td>Intervals, Endurance, Time trials</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Polarisation</td>
                <td>Improve oxidative capacity</td>
                <td>4, 5, 6</td>
                <td>Intervals, Endurance</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Differentiation</td>
                <td>Increase speed and power</td>
                <td>7, 8, 9</td>
                <td>Intervals, Endurance, Polarisation, Time trials</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FLUX</td>
                <td>Zero-rest intervals</td>
                <td>10, 11, 12</td>
                <td>Intervals, Endurance, Polarisation, FLUX</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3 id="program-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        The Polarisation and Differentiation phases (months 4 to 9) are split in two
        tracks that you can choose from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pure capacity</strong> ergometer only track. Workouts are
                apparatus only.</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolic Conditioning (MetCon)</strong> track.
                Workouts utilise multi-movement patterns with varying equipment
                (eg. barbells, dumbbells, wallballs, jump rope, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="graph-tracks"></div>
        <p>
        It is possible to mix and match between tracks, and change tracks
        between phases.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workouts">Workouts</h3>
        <p>
        Workouts were received via email each month as a single .pdf file. Each
        file contains four weeks of workouts, each week having five workouts to
        complete.
        </p>
        <p>
        An exception to this format is the first month of the program, in
        which the fifth workout in each week is optional.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-workout-types">Workout types</h3>
        <div id="graph-workout-types"></div>
        <p>
        Each workout type is described below. As <a
             href="#about-this-review-workout-obfuscation">mentioned above</a>, only a
        select number of workouts are described in full in this document; all
        other workout descriptions are obfuscated according to the rules below.

        <p>
        Year of the Engine uses ergometers. The program as supplied gives options for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rowing on the Concept2 indoor rowing machine or similar;</li>
            <li>Skiing on the Concept2 SkiErg or similar;</li>
            <li>Biking on the Assault Bike, Echo Bike, BikeErg, AirDyne or
                similar; and</li>
            <li>Running.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Each workout can use a different apparatus if desired.  Scalings are
        supplied when necessary, and the program strongly suggests which
        machines are <i>not</i> suitable for certain workouts.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-additional-training">Additional Training</h3>
        <p>
        The program can be run as standalone or in addition to other training.
        Integration with other training is left to the athlete to manage.

        <h3 id="methodology-tracks">Tracks</h3>
        <p>
        As <a href="#program-workouts">previously noted</a>, there are two tracks you
        can choose during the Polarisation and Differentiation phases: pure capacity or
        metabolic conditioning.
        </p>
        <p class="self">
        I chose <strong>pure capacity</strong>. All references to workouts in
        this review will only be for this track, and not for the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-scheduling">Scheduling</h3>
        <p>
        The program places no restriction on what days workouts are to occur,
        only that each weeks' workouts are to be completed before moving to the
        next week.
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program deliberately allows you to move workouts around during the week in
        order to fit in with other training and life.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I tried to do shorter workouts (intervals, time trials) at the start
            of the week, and longer workouts (endurance, polarisation, FLUX) at
            the end of the week and the weekend to fit in with life. Worked
            well for me.
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose not to explicitly schedule rest days, taking a day off when
            tired or if life conflicted with normal training times.
            </p>
            <p>
            My workouts were predominantly done between 05:00 and 09:00 prior
            to first meal of the day.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="methodology-additional-training">Additional training</h3>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            During the Polarisation and Differentiation phases, I was able to
            fit in strength training of less than 45 minutes, between two and
            three times per week. Exercises rotated between various
            combinations of back squat, press, deadlift, front squat, bench
            press and pull-ups.  Maintenance weight only; loads did not
            increase. These workouts were done immediately before the scheduled
            Year of the Engine workout for that day.
            </p>

            <p>
            I completed perhaps a half-dozen MetCon workouts over the course of
            the program, as part of social events and not as part of training. I
            did not do a Year of the Engine workout on these days due to lack of
            time.
            </p>

            <p>
            All other exercise was incidental. This included road and mountain
            bike riding, an occasional swimming session, and  playing with my
            kids.

        <h3 id="methodology-recording-results">Recording results</h3>
        <p>
        The .pdf supplied each month has space to write results and specifies
        what to record for each workout. Matt suggests printing out each sheet
        and recording results in this fashion.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        On the rower and SkiErg I used Concept2's <a
            target="_blank" href="https://concept2.com/ergdata">ErgData</a>
        application to record each session. The AirDyne lacks automated
        recording, so I took a photo of the monitor at the end of each workout
        and tabled the results in a spreadsheet.
        </p>

        <h3 id="methodology-execution">Execution</h3>
        <p>
        I started the program on Monday 16th September 2019, and finished on
        16th September, 2020. Workouts, and their phases, were completed as
        below.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-execution-summary"></div>

        <h4 id="objective-results-in-program-tests-10-minute-air-bike">10:00.0
            Air Bike time trial</h4>
        <p>
        The 10:00.0 air bike test is scheduled three times in phase 1 (weeks 4, 8,
        12) and three times in phase 3 (weeks 25, 29, 33). These tests are not
        placed ouside of the workout schedule; they are included as part of
        training. No special preparation was taken for these tests. Warm-up was
        roughly 3-4 minutes at below Endurance pace, 3-4 minutes at Endurance
        pace, 1-2 minutes above Endurance pace.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-tt-airdyne"></div>
        <p>
        There was 11.2% increase in calories recorded by the AirDyne monitor
        between the first and last test.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            There's not much in the way of exposition for these tests. The goal
            each time was to increase number of calories from the last test, and
            to be as consistent as possible. Couldn't quite get to 200cals in
            the last test.
            </p>
            <p>
            The AirDyne doesn't have any way of recording intra-workout metrics;
            it would have been nice to see where pace changes occurred in order
            to develop a better approach than &ldquo;got fast and survive&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
            All six tests felt RPE 10. The last two tests I did not feel the need
            to collapse on the floor to recover, instead sitting upright and
            slowly pedalling.

        <p>
        The 20:00.0 rower test is scheduled three times in phase 3 (weeks 27,
        31, 35). These tests are not placed outside of the workout schedule;
        they are included as part of training. No special preparation was taken
        for these tests. Warm up was 10:00.0 build drill.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-tt-rower"></div>
        <p>
        There was 2.8% increase in calories recorded by the rower monitor
        between the first and last test. Pace increased by 1.3s/500m between
        tests 1 and 2, but only 0.1s/500m between tests 2 and 3.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
        Test 3 felt very poor. I was unwell at the end of the previous week and
        was most likely still recovering. While faster than test 1, it was
        equal to test 2. I bonked with less than 4 minutes to go, whereas pace
        was held throughout tests 1 and 2. We can see this by examining the pace
        for each test:

        <p>
        Distance and pace improved, albeit marginally. Calories were lower in
        attempt 2, again marginally. Stroke rate was lower, as were total
        strokes. There were 9 months between the workouts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was attempt 2 an improvement over attempt 1?</li>
            <li>If so, why wasn't it bigger, since 9 months of training had
                elapsed?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Let's start with stroke count, as it sticks out the most. The 2nd
        attempt recorded 16 fewer strokes.  We can see where this happened by
        looking at the number of strokes per interval:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-strokesPerInterval"></div>
        <p>
        Attempt 2 had one less stroke in 16 of the 24 intervals
        compared to the attempt 1. We know the 2nd attempt covered further
        distance, so we can make the presumption that in the 2nd attempt, the
        <u>distance per stroke increased</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
        What is the impact of one fewer stroke per interval over the same
        distance? We can examine distance each interval, and graph by stroke:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-distancePerIntervalAllStrokes"></div>
        <p>
        As attempt 2 drops strokes compared to attempt 1, it's graph
        &ldquo;shifts left&rdquo;, until it is 16 strokes ahead of attempt 1.
        Attempt 2 has completed the same distance as attempt 1, but with fewer
        strokes. And the 16 strokes difference 2 matches our variance previously
        tabled.
        </p>

        <p>
        So how far apart are the attempts at each interval?  Using attempt 1 as
        a baseline, we can graph attempt 2's increase or decrease in distance
        per interval:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-distanceDeltaPerInterval"></div>

        We can see that compared to attempt 1, attempt 2 started out with a
        large lead in interval 1, continued building through to interval 15,
        then recorded reduced distance in intervals 17 to 24.  We can visualise
        the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; by accumulating this difference each interval:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-bankedDistanceByInterval"></div>
        <p>
        By interval 15, attempt 2 has accumulated a lead of 29m over attempt 1.
        This gain is eroded as the workout continues. The distance remaining in
        attempt 2's bank at the end of the last interval is 7m, which matches
        our variance previously tabled.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, we have yet to determine <i>why</i> the distance discrepancy
        appears. Was attempt 1 slow opening then sped up? Did attempt 2 do the
        opposite? Let's look at pace in each interval.
        </p>

        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-pacePerInterval"></div>
        <p>
        The points representing pace for attempt 1 appear to vary more than
        attempt 2. We can look at the distribution for both paces:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-normalDistributionPace"></div>
        <p>
        Attempt 2 indeed had a <u>more consistent pace</u> per interval than
        attempt 1. One last thing to look at are watts generated per stroke:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-wattsPerStroke"></div>

        <p>
        The spikes are where the Performance Monitor on the rower (PM)
        erroneously picks up incorrect distance on the first stroke of the
        interval. These are balanced out when we calculate the distribution of
        power per stroke:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-repeated-24_30_30-normalDistributionWatts"></div>

        <p>
        Attempt 2 generated marginally <u>more power per stroke</u> than attempt
        1, with a slightly improved consistency.
        </p>

        <p>
        Summing up: objectively we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt 2 used fewer strokes to go further.</li>
            <li>Attempt 2 had a lower calorie cost.</li>
            <li>Attempt 2 showed more consistency in pace.</li>
            <li>Attempt 2 showed more power per stroke.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Subjectively, we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attempt 2 RPE improved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        We can summarise the above points by saying attempt 2 was more
        <strong>efficiently executed</strong> than attempt 1. That is, attempt 2
        achieved virtually the same result as attempt 1 but utilising better
        more consistent power delivery. We can say attempt 2 was an improvement
        over attempt 1.
        </p>
        <p>
        But this conclusion still doesn't explain why there wasn't more a
        <strong>significant</strong> increase in performance between the two
        workouts given the amount of training!
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            And here's where my mistake comes in. When I repeat a workout, I
            check my previous result, consider how I'm feeling, predict how much
            faster I could complete the work, and use that as my goal. When I
            checked my history, I accidently looked up
            <strong>2<u>0</u>x0:30/0:30r</strong> (instead of
            2<u>4</u>x0:30/0:30r) which was done six weeks earlier than attempt
            1.
            </p>
            <p>
            So, for attempt 2, I conservatively took a second off the pace for
            20x0:30/0:30r, and aimed for 1:39.5, not realising I should have
            been aiming for 1:38.3.
            </p>
            <p>
            End result was a pace of 1:39.1; an improvement on 20x0:30/0:30r, an
            improvement on 24x0:30/0:30r, faster than the goal pace set at the
            start of the workout, and with a lowered RPE.
            </p>
            <p>
            This yields an interesting observation: I was easily able to hold
            the pace required to hit my goal. If my goal pace was 1:38.3, I
            believe that at the time of attempt 2 I would have been able to hit
            that, perhaps at a higher RPE, but hit it nonetheless.

        <p>
        My approach to workouts has changed. The higher-than-comfortable
        sustained "steady state" work from the program has changed my perception
        of the usefulness of fly-and-die. I now temper opening rounds in a
        workout aiming for 100% consistency instead of going too hard early
        and trying to recover on the run.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subjective-observations-phenomenom-of-fast-finishes">The phenomenom of fast finishes</h3>
        <p>
        While completing phase 1, I started to notice that many of my interval
        results were following a similar pattern: the last interval was usually
        at a higher pace than the previous intervals, and many had started
        including a kick toward the end, like below:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-interval.workout_40553854"></div>
        <p>
        Sometimes I couldn't hold the kick all the way to the end of the
        interval, but inexplicibly, my pace stayed above the average for
        that interval, like below:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-interval.workout_41335805"></div>
        <p>
        It's not negative splits, I didn't feel that I sandbagged these
        workouts, and I had chosen paces that I knew I could hold across all
        intervals without going to fast nor slow.

            of perceived exertion scale</a> (RPE) is a measure of
            <i>perceived</i> exertion of a physical activity. The biggest change
            I feel related to RPE is being able to hold pace on the air bike.  A
            year ago, holding a 29-30kph pace on the AirDyne for 20:00 was my
            limit, and rated it RPE 10. I am now able to hold the same pace for

        <p>
        My &ldquo;skill&rdquo; level on the air bike has significantly improved.
        The cycling motion is now more refined with significantly less lateral
        movement. In particular, bobbing of the head left and right has
        vanished, with torso remaining much more still and upright. These
        improvements feel like I'm putting more energy into the bike rather
        than away from it.

            in early 2020:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
            Up until end of last year, I would donate plasma on a Saturday
            morning after a workout, then rest until late Sunday afternoon to do
            my next workout - averaging between 30 and 33 hours of rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            Schedule change at start of the year meant donating on Sunday
            morning, resting until Monday morning workout - averaging between 23
            to 25 hours of rest. So a decrease of around 7 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since the schedule change, I've noticed significant drop offs in
            performance in that first workout after donating. The sensation
            during the workout isn't of a fatigue brick, huge drop in energy or
            I-think-I'm-dying; it's more of a "I can't sustain this pace even
            though I should be able to," and so I slow to make it through
            without stopping. Subsequent workouts, spaced at 24-hour periods,
            are fine.
            </p>
            <p>
            All other things being equal, the altered rest period
            seems to affect me significantly, with age no doubt playing a part
            too. Some random Googling turned up

        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Followed the program</strong>. Adherence
                to the program was initially difficult, but once a proper
                schedule was established, and an understanding of the amount of
                effort required to complete the first couple of months was
                achieved, it became much easier to follow the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Moved workouts around inside the training
                week</strong>. In order to fit the workouts into my schedule, it
                was necessary to move them within the week rather than strictly
                follow the program. This is provided for in the program. Had I
                tried to do the workouts in order as written, it would have
                been nearly impossible to fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Rested only when necessary, not more</strong>. I explicitly
                chose not schedule rest days into my week, instead opting to
                rest when tired or when non-training events prevented training.
                This worked well; some weeks I would do 6 days in a row,
                starting the next weeks' training early. Other weeks life would
                get in the way and I might miss a few days in a row. I feel if I
                had tried to stick hard to a schedule, I would have missed a lot
                more days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-got-wrong">What I know got wrong</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Not stretching</strong>. During phase 2, I started
                getting a lot of lower back, glute and hip flexor pain. This
                was probably caused by an increase of time on the AirDyne
                during this phase. I was not used to sitting on a stationary
                bike in cycling position for extended periods and had poor form.
                The rower was the primary apparatus on the previous phase and
                did not contribute to any symptoms. I implemented a stretching
                plan into my schedule and gradually the pain subsided.</li>

            <li><strong>Overly optimistic endurance pace selection</strong>.
                Phase 2, Polarisation, requires selection of an
                <i>endurance&nbsp; pace</i>, which is held as a minimum pace
                during Polarisation workouts. It is described by Matt as:
                <blockquote>
                Endurance pace may be best understood like this: Your friend
                enters the gym and walks over to say hello.  You have sufficient
                oxygen such that you can say a quick hello, ask him politely how
                it's going, but cannot carry on a conversation of any length.
                </blockquote>
                My initial endurance pace estimate was too fast, and as
                workouts became longer, it was more difficult to hold onto
                pace. I took too many workouts to realise this was the
                problem. However once the penny dropped, I used the next couple
                of Polarisation workouts to narrow down the pace to better match
                Matt's description.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="reflection-what-i-would-change">What I think I would change</h3>
        <ul class="space">
            <li><strong>Spread workouts across more apparatus</strong>.
                Throughout the Differentiation and FLUX phases I worked mainly
                on the AirDyne, only doing intervals on the rower and
                occasionally the SkiErg. While the main reasons for this was
                comfort on longer sessions, I suspect balancing out work across
                apparatus would be a more beneficial approach, giving more
                resilience to longer workouts on the rower and SkiErg. Going
                into the second Year of the Engine program, I will try to spread
                the work out more evenly.</li>

            <li><strong>Include some workouts from the MetCon track</strong>.
                I chose to just do the ergometer track, foregoing any
                weightlifting and gymnastics movements. Going into year two I
                will definitely be leaning toward any available MetCon track in
                order to practice and improve other skills, as well as
                incorporate weighted movements.</li>

            <li><strong>Reassess endurance pace</strong>. Towards the end of
                phase 4, I felt that endurance workouts were not providing
                enough challenge, and even though the duration increased my RPE
                dropped.  Reassessing endurance pace at the start of phase
                3 and 4 may have helped keep the same RPE.</li>

            <li><strong>Upgrade the air bike</strong>. I used the Schwinn
                AirDyne 6 as my air bike, and aside from showing its age, it
                has no method to accurately track effort and does not recall
                past workouts. I would like to be able to get performance data
                as per the Concept2 rower and SkiErg, some of which is
                visualised in the graphs in this review. Perhaps a Concept2
                BikeErg is on the horizon.</li>

        <h2 id="program-review">Program review</h2>
        <p class="self">
        From here on is entirely my opinion. Data is from my results. Feel free to disagree.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-structure">Program Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is simply structured and easy to follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 workouts each week.</li>
            <li>4 weeks' worth of workouts provided at the start of the training
                month.</li>
            <li>3 months per phase.</li>
            <li>4 phases over the entire of year one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Adjustments available to the athlete are similarly simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move workouts around in a week as you see fit.</li>
            <li>Complete all workouts in a week before moving to the next.</li>
            <li>Complete one phase before moving to the next.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Each phase has instructions which are provided with the first month of
        that phase. Each workout is described without superfluous verbage.
        There is virtually no room for over-interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-flexibility">Program flexibility</h3>
        <p>
        While highly structured, the program does provide <i>some</i> flexibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It can be used as a standalone conditioning program;</li>
            <li>It can be scheduled to fit in with an existing training
                schedule;</li>
            <li>Workouts fit a range of apparatus.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The program assumes knowledge in how to operate your chosen apparatuses;
        it provides no instruction here.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are seeking a program that you can tailor beyond the above, then
        you may be disappointed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-program-requirements">Program requirements</h3>
        <p>
        While the program is geared towards having access to a rowing machine
        and an air bike, other forms of exercise can be substituted. SkiErg has
        been mentioned, and there are scalings provided for running. Matt has
        also mentioned some athletes choosing swimming for some workouts.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have access to a gym, or are able to run, you will have access to
        at least one form of activity suited to the program.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-description">Workout description</h3>
        <p>
        Each workout is clear, short, simply stated and unambiguous. 'nuff said.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is no warm-up or warm-down specified.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-intensity">Workout intensity</h3>
        <p>
        The intensity of each phase is described in the instructions received
        at the start of that phase. For example, part of the FLUX instructions:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            If you're unable to hit the suggested FLUX pace, that's OK. Go as
            high as you can, provided that you can sustain endurance pace
            between FLUX intervals.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Similarly to the <a href="#program-review-workout-description">workout
            description</a>, instructions on intensity are clear and
        unambiguous.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-workout-target-metric">Workout target metric</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the MetCon track.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of the 240 workouts in the program, only 8 specify a set distance
        as the workout target metric. That is, 8 workouts are &ldquo;for
        time&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;complete the distance while minimising the
        amount of time working&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other 232 workouts specify a set time as the metric.  These
        workouts are &ldquo;for distance&rdquo;, as the goal is to maintain or
        maximise distance in a given time frame. High <u>sustainable</u> effort
        yields reward here.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-duration"></div>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts specify the workout duration
        in the description, so scheduling is easy. &ldquo;For time&rdquo;
        workouts are less simple to schedule, as the duration of the workout
        relies entirely on how fast you can complete the work.
        </p>
        <p>
        &ldquo;For distance&rdquo; workouts are also easier to scale across not
        only apparatus, but also athletes. A 3:00.0 effort requires no scaling
        of time between a rower, SkiErg or air bike. Similarly, 3:00.0 for a
        novice and 3:00.0 for an elite are the same domain; only the skill
        level on the apparatus and the intensity brought by the athlete differ.
        </p>

        <p class="self">
            I found &ldquo;for distance&rdquo; workouts yielded much more
            consistent results than past attempts at other programs which
            focused on minimising time, even when working at higher than
            &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; paces.
        </p>
        <p>
        Longer workouts, such as Endurance, warn against unbalanced effort:
        </p>
        <img class="centre"
             src="images/consistent-pace-do-not-sprint.png"
             alt="consistent pace do not sprint" />

        <p class="self">
        I balanced the urge to sprint is with the knowledge that the time domain is
        fixed: sprinting too early would result in limping home, yielding an
        inconsistent pace. Not what the workout is asking for.
        </p>

        <p>
        There is definitely the right time and place in the program to sprint:
        the speed and threshold Interval workouts require effort at and above
        race pace, time trials by definition are sprints, and the Polarisation
        and FLUX workouts will truly test your mettle with sustained,
        above-&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; speeds with even faster bursts.
        </p>
        <p>
        Conditioning can be considered the result of repeated, sustained effort
        <u>over time</u>.  <a

            here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-time-commitment">Time commitment</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>
        <p>
        The length of a workout depends on the workout type and workout
        specifics for that day.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-time-commitment-summary"></div>
        <p>
        Daily workout duration changes over the length of the program.
        Time trials were 20:00 or less, Intervals and FLUX remained around
        30:00, Endurance and Polarisation workouts gradually increased, capping
        at an hour.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-time-commitment-sd-by-type"></div>

        <h3 id="program-review-constantly-varied">Constantly varied?</h3>
        <p class="self">
        Note: this observation is based on the pure capacity track I followed,
        not the the MetCon track.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each workout is variation on the theme of the workout type: Intervals
        are interleaved periods of work and rest, Endurance is long &ldquo;steady
        state&rdquo;, Polarisation is shorter-length endurance but with bursts
        of max effort, and so on. As such, while each workout changes in it's
        fine details, the theme of each type of workout remains consistent. We
        can chart workout type across the program to see how they are spread:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-spread-scatter"></div>
        <p>
        The last workout type from the previous week may start the new week off.
        Overall the workout types are spread well, and as mentioned previously,
        the athlete may move them around within a workout week to suit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Interval workouts dominate phase 1. Phase 2 reduces Intervals, balancing
        them with the introduction of Polarisation and steady Endurance work.
        Phase 3 maintains Intervals, reduces Polarisation and slighly increases
        Endurance. The program ends in phase 4 with emphasis on FLUX workouts.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-workout-spread-pies"></div>

        <p>
        Apparatus choice is a variable in the program. Here are my chosen
        apparatus against workout duration:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-constantly-varied-apparatus"></div>

        <p>
        At times the program felt <i>grindy</i> - a lot of time, a lot of
        sweat, with the only difference between like-themed workouts being a
        small detail.  The time trials are in phases 1 and 3, so at times it's
        difficult to gauge how you are progressing in phases 2 and 4.
        </p>
        <p>
        But there is magic here. Or rather, <strong>intent</strong>. A closer
        examination of individual workouts in each workout type across an entire
        phase show a consistent increase in the variables of duration, rest,
        and intensity. Not huge leaps and bounds, but a regular, steady
        increase. All these small increases put together create a tidy,
        measured and most importantly achievable progression in intensity.
        </p>

        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phase 2, when Polarisation was introduced, to be the most
            physically difficult. The intensity increased, workout length
            increased, and while I felt like I was improving, I had no hard
            data to back it up. This is in contrast to phase 1, where there were
            three time trials to gauge progress.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, after completing phase 2, and specifically after the time
            trials in phase 3, it became overwhelmingly obvious that the
            <i>grind</i> in phase 2 provided the foundation for results in phase
            3 and especially in phase 4.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
        Is the program <strong>on the pure capacity track</strong> constantly
        varied?  In the CrossFit sense of &ldquo;constantly varied&rdquo;, no.
        Yet this is on purpose, and the
        <a

            why is well worth the read</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 id="program-review-mental-fortitude">Mental fortitude</h3>
        <p>
        The length of time that you spend each day on the program will test your
        ability to &ldquo;embrace the suck.&rdquo; Whether shorter Intervals at
        high number of rounds, or longer Endurance workouts at a sustained pace
        with bursts, all of the workouts require a mental committment to
        complete.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            I found phases 1 and 2 to be the most mentally difficult. Intervals
            never seemed to end, even knowing how long the workout was going to
            be. And with the introduction of Polarisation in phase 2, I was
            spending a lot more time on the bike than I ever had. It was hard
            being in inside my head with no escape for long periods, grinding
            away.
            </p>
            <p>
            Strangely, I found phases 3 and 4 to be less mentally exhausting, as
            my focus shifted toward maintaining sustained output with less (or
            no) rest for longer periods. Familiarisation with the workouts
            possibly helped. Could I be getting fitter?
            </p>
            <p>
            Bizarrely, workouts in phase 4 became less mentally <i>taxing</i>
            and more mentally <i>challenging</i>. Instead of aiming for
            survival, the emphasis changed to something like a game -
            how close to pace I could stay while pushing a bit harder on the max
            bursts? This phase almost became fun.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="program-review-recovery">Recovery</h3>
        <p>
        The program doesn't dictate what recovery should be or when it should
        occur. The opening month is 4 working days per week, with a fifth day
        being optional. From the second month, 5 workouts are to be completed
        per week. It is assumed that the athlete would listen well to their
        body, and determine the right time to rest and recover.
        </p>
        <p>
        The apparatus suggested by the program are largely non-impact, reducing
        the need for the body to absorb significant shocks for extended periods,
        in turn reducing the amount of soreness and time needed for recovery.
        Running is the exception; care should be taken when choosing which
        workouts to run, and how best to recover.
        </p>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            On a few occasions I did six days in a row with no soreness or
            ill-effect.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, <a href="#reflection-what-i-got-wrong">a lack of stretching
                did cause me some issues</a>.

        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Year of the Engine is a program designed to improve cardiovascular
        capacity. I completed the first year, following the instructions as
        provided, and demonstrated significant improvements in the 10:00.0 air
        bike time trial, stayed within 5% of competition paces for 500m and 2k
        indoor rowing events with no specific preparation, and had no reduction
        in MetCon ability.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program is administered simply. A monthly email provides workouts
        for the month. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. The
        rationale and reasoning behind the program are public and easy to
        digest.
        </p>
        <p>
        The program does not discriminate against the novice, intermediate or
        advanced athlete. Workouts are overwhelmingly fixed duration, so
        intensity is left entirely to the athlete to determine. Guidance is
        provided for intensity for each workout type.
        </p>
        <p>
        Support is readily available from the program author. A group to discuss
        the program is available for those doing the program.
        </p>

        <h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>
        <div class="self">
            <p>
            If you want to improve capacity, this is an excellent program to follow.
            As a beyond-novice-but-not-a-fully-intermediate exerciser, with limited
            time to train and regular day-to-day stresses and interruptions, I found
            the program readily accessible, schedule-forgiving and physically and
            mentally challenging. And I did get capacity gains, as demonstrated
            by my results.
            </p>
            <p>
            I feel novices would benefit greatly from this program as it has a
            very simple structure, is well documented and unambiguous. Get familiar
            with the apparatus first and make time for recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Intermediate athletes would discover, particularly in phase 1, where
            the holes in their fitness are. The remainder of the program will
            fill those holes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Advanced and elites would be pushed beyond their limits. Phase 2 and
            3 would be an opportunity for them to drastically improve their
            mental game.
            </p>
            <p>
            I thoroughly enjoyed year one of Year of the Engine and am looking
            forward to year two.
