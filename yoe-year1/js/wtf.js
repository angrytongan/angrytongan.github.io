    <h2>Year of the Engine Year 1 pretty graphs</h2>

    <p>
    These graphs below are visual representations of data I collected while
    doing year one of <a href="https://www.thegainslab.com/engine">The Gains
    Lab Year of the Engine</a> conditioning program.
    </p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
    There are regular questions on the <a
    href="https://reddit.com/r/crossfit">CrossFit subreddit</a> asking about
    Year of the Engine (example threads:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/d6fdn4/for_folks_that_have_done_year_of_the_engine/">1</a>,
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/emrtsf/is_there_anyone_who_is_currently_doing_the_gains/">2</a>,

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/d7dee8/any_of_you_that_could_share_your_results_with/">4</a>).
    The data below may help give you an idea of the amount
    of work and time involved in the program. I include some of my results as
    well.

    Through careful examination of the graphs, you may infer when life
    (illness, injury, family, travel) got in the way of training.
    </p>

    <h3>Workouts</h3>
    <p>
    Each graph uses data that comes entirely from recorded results. Workout
    specific information has been removed; aside from the time trials,
    <strong><i>there are no workouts, programs or prescriptions</i></strong>
    described here. If you are interested in doing the program and want to know
    what the workouts look like, contact <a href="https://thegainslab.com">The
    Gains Lab</a> and politely ask for a sample workout. Matt and the guys are
    awesome and will help you out.
